abstract = "A critical assessment of previous theoretical descriptions of membrane nanofiltration shows that the good agreement with experimental data is due to the use of the ratio of effective membrane thickness to membrane porosity as an arbitrary fitting parameter. A more rigorous analysis shows that rejection is independent of membrane thickness. A model allowing calculation of uncharged solute rejection on the basis of a single membrane parameter (pore radius) is developed. The theoretical description is based on a hydrodynamic model of hindered solute transport in pores. The dependence of solute chemical potential on pressure is included, although its effect is shown to be small. A variation of solvent viscosity with pore radius is also included. For pores of a single size, such variation has no effect on rejection, though it will become important for overall membrane rejection if a pore size distribution is included. The good agreement between this model and experimental data confirms that uncharged solute rejection in nanofiltration membranes may be well-described by such a continuum model. A two-parameter model (pore radius and membrane charge) for electrolyte rejection has been developed that includes dielectric exclusion in the form of an energy barrier to ion partitioning into the pores. Reassessment of the pore dielectric constant using NaCl rejection at the isoelectric point of a Desal-DK membrane resulted in significantly better agreement with experimental rejection data than use of the high frequency solvent dielectric constant for an oriented layer of water molecules at the pore walls. The predicted values of effective membrane charge density were not only significantly reduced in magnitude, and hence more realistic, than those from previous models, but their variation with concentration for divalent salts was in better agreement with physical models of ion adsorption. The theoretical descriptions of the present paper are developed more rigorously than those previously published. Their overall agreement with experimental data is good and the resulting membrane parameters are likely to be more closely related to physical membrane properties than those obtained from previous models. The descriptions are useful for membrane process assessment and prediction. They also provide a sound basis for further developments."

abstract  ="Developing electrophysiological platforms to capture electrical activities of neurons and exert modulatory stimuli lays the foundation for many neuroscience-related disciplines{,} including the neuron–machine interface{,} neuroprosthesis{,} and mapping of brain circuitry. Intrinsically more advantageous than genetic and chemical neuronal probes{,} electrical interfaces directly target the fundamental driving force—transmembrane currents—behind the complicated and diverse neuronal signals{,} allowing for the discovery of neural computational mechanisms of the most accurate extent. Furthermore{,} establishing electrical access to neurons is so far the most promising solution to integrate large-scale{,} high-speed modern electronics with neurons that are highly dynamic and adaptive. Over the evolution of electrode-based electrophysiologies{,} there has long been a trade-off in terms of precision{,} invasiveness{,} and parallel access due to limitations in fabrication techniques and insufficient understanding of membrane–electrode interactions. On the one hand{,} intracellular platforms based on patch clamps and sharp electrodes suffer from acute cellular damage{,} fluid diffusion{,} and labor-intensive micromanipulation{,} with little room for parallel recordings. On the other hand{,} conventional extracellular microelectrode arrays cannot detect from subcellular compartments or capture subthreshold membrane potentials because of the large electrode size and poor seal resistance{,} making it impossible to depict a comprehensive picture of a neuron{'}s electrical activities. Recently{,} the application of nanotechnology on neuronal electrophysiology has brought about a promising solution to mitigate these conflicts on a single chip. In particular{,} three dimensional nanostructures of 10–100 nm in diameter are naturally fit to achieve the purpose of precise and localized interrogations. Engineering them into vertical nanoprobes bound on planar substrates resulted in excellent membrane–electrode seals and high-density electrode distribution. There is no doubt that 3D vertical nanoelectrodes have achieved a fundamental milestone in terms of high precision{,} low invasiveness{,} and parallel recording at the neuron–electrode interface{,} albeit with there being substantial engineering issues that remain before the potential of nano neural interfaces can be fully exploited. Within this framework{,} we review the qualitative breakthroughs and opportunities brought about by 3D vertical nanoelectrodes{,} and discuss the major limitations of current electrode designs with respect to rational and seamless cell-on-chip systems."}

abstract = {Current-source density (CSD) analysis is a well-established method for analyzing recorded local field potentials (LFPs), that is, the low-frequency part of extracellular potentials. Standard CSD theory is based on the assumption that all extracellular currents are purely ohmic, and thus neglects the possible impact from ionic diffusion on recorded potentials. However, it has previously been shown that in physiological conditions with large ion-concentration gradients, diffusive currents can evoke slow shifts in extracellular potentials. Using computer simulations, we here show that diffusion-evoked potential shifts can introduce errors in standard CSD analysis, and can lead to prediction of spurious current sources. Further, we here show that the diffusion-evoked prediction errors can be removed by using an improved CSD estimator which accounts for concentration-dependent effects.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ?60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30\% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

  Abstract                 = {Exposed to a sufficiently high extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]), the neuron can fire spontaneous discharges or even become inactivated due to membrane depolarisation ('depolarisation block'). Since these phenomena likely are related to the maintenance and propagation of seizure discharges, it is of considerable importance to understand the conditions under which excess [K( + )]₀ causes them. To address the putative effect of glial buffering on neuronal activity under elevated [K( + )](o) conditions, we combined a recently developed dynamical model of glial membrane ion and water transport with a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model. In this interconnected glia-neuron model we investigated the effects of natural heterogeneity or pathological changes in glial membrane transporter density by considering a large set of models with different, yet empirically plausible, sets of model parameters. We observed both the high [K( + )]₀-induced duration of spontaneous neuronal firing and the prevalence of depolarisation block to increase when reducing the magnitudes of the glial transport mechanisms. Further, in some parameter regions an oscillatory bursting spiking pattern due to the dynamical coupling of neurons and glia was observed. Bifurcation analyses of the neuron model and of a simplified version of the neuron-glia model revealed further insights about the underlying mechanism behind these phenomena. The above insights emphasise the importance of combining neuron models with detailed astroglial models when addressing phenomena suspected to be influenced by the astroglia-neuron interaction. To facilitate the use of our neuron-glia model, a CellML version of it is made publicly available.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept that astrocytes release neuroactive molecules (gliotransmitters) to affect synaptic transmission has been a paradigm shift in neuroscience research over the past decade. This concept suggests that astrocytes, together with pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements, make up a functional synapse. Astrocyte release of gliotransmitters (for example, glutamate and adenosine triphosphate) is generally accepted to be a Ca2+-dependent process. We used two mouse lines to either selectively increase or obliterate astrocytic Gq G protein-coupled receptor Ca2+ signaling to further test the hypothesis that astrocytes release gliotransmitters in a Ca2+-dependent manner to affect synaptic transmission. Neither increasing nor obliterating astrocytic Ca2+ fluxes affects spontaneous and evoked excitatory synaptic transmission or synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest that, at least in the hippocampus, the mechanisms of gliotransmission need to be reconsidered.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of astrocytes, one part of the glial system, for information processing in the brain has recently been demonstrated. Regarding information processing in multilayer connectionist systems, it has been shown that systems which include artificial neurons and astrocytes (Artificial Neuron-Glia Networks) have well-known advantages over identical systems including only artificial neurons. Since the actual impact of astrocytes in neural network function is unknown, we have investigated, using computational models, different astrocyte-neuron interactions for information processing; different neuron-glia algorithms have been implemented for training and validation of multilayer Artificial Neuron-Glia Networks oriented toward classification problem resolution. The results of the tests performed suggest that all the algorithms modelling astrocyte-induced synaptic potentiation improved artificial neural network performance, but their efficacy depended on the complexity of the problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Anatomic and physiologic data are used to analyze the energy expenditure on different components of excitatory signaling in the grey matter of rodent brain. Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47\% and 34\%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13\%), and glutamate recycling using only 3\%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with <or=15\% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.},

abstract = {Extracellular local field potentials are usually modeled as arising from a set of current sources embedded in a homogeneous extracellular medium. Although this formalism can successfully model several properties of extracellular local field potentials, it does not account for their frequency-dependent attenuation with distance, a property essential to correctly model extracellular spikes. Here we derive expressions for the extracellular potential that include this frequency-dependent attenuation. We first show that, if the extracellular conductivity is nonhomogeneous, there is induction of nonhomogeneous charge densities that may result in a low-pass filter. We next derive a simplified model consisting of a punctual (or spherical) current source with spherically symmetric conductivity/permittivity gradients around the source. We analyze the effect of different radial profiles of conductivity and permittivity on the frequency-filtering behavior of this model. We show that this simple model generally displays low-pass filtering behavior, in which fast electrical events (such as Na(+)-mediated action potentials) attenuate very steeply with distance, whereas slower (K(+)-mediated) events propagate over larger distances in extracellular space, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. This simple model can be used to obtain frequency-dependent extracellular field potentials without taking into account explicitly the complex folding of extracellular space.},

Macroscopic measurements in cortical tissue demonstrated that electric conductivity (as well as permittivity) is frequency-dependent, while other measurements failed to evidence any dependence on frequency. In this article, we propose a model of the genesis of LFPs that accounts for the above data and contradictions. Starting from first principles (Maxwell equations), we introduce a macroscopic formalism in which macroscopic measurements are naturally incorporated, and also examine different physical causes for the frequency dependence. We suggest that ionic diffusion primes over electric field effects, and is responsible for the frequency dependence. This explains the contradictory observations, and also reproduces the 1/f power spectral structure of LFPs, as well as more complex frequency scaling. Finally, we suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current propagation in biological tissue, and which could be used to directly test the predictions of this formalism.},

  Abstract                 = {cAMP analogues such as dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP) have been shown to induce the formation of processes in cultured primary astrocytes. We observe that the processes form by elongation as well as the previously reported retraction of cytoplasm around cytoskeletal elements. The most prominent cytoskeletal change that occurs in response to dBcAMP is a rearrangement of actin filaments characterized by a loss of cortical F-actin staining and the appearance of actin filament staining at the tips of the processes. If cortical actin filaments are disrupted with dihydrocytochalasin B, processes form that are similar to those induced by dBcAMP suggesting that the disruption of the cortical actin network is the pivotal step in process formation. Reorganization of the actin filament network in response to cAMP is accompanied by a decrease in phosphate incorporation into the regulatory light chain of myosin (MLC). Two selective inhibitors of MLC kinase (MLCK), ML-9 and KT5926, as well as a calmodulin antagonist (W7), which would also inhibit MLCK activation, all induce astrocytic process growth implicating MLCK as a control point in process initiation. We also found that dBcAMP and ML-9 both cause a decrease in the phosphate content of actin depolymerizing factor, suggesting that this protein and myosin light chain are the effectors of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and process growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Epileptic seizures are characterized by abnormal electrical discharge. In previous studies we established a powerful antiepileptic action for a commonly used diuretic (furosemide). However, it remains unclear precisely how furosemide terminates abnormal electrical discharges. To address this issue, we performed in vitro experiments to examine conditions where furosemide exerts antiepileptic activity and patch-clamp studies to analyze the effect of furosemide on neuronal membrane properties, synaptic function and inward potassium current. Furosemide was not found to alter synaptic field responses, excitatory postsynaptic currents or intrinsic membrane properties of principal hippocampal neurons. Our in vitro studies indicate that furosemide does not abolish spontaneous epileptiform bursting during co-application of Ba2+ or Cs+ ions (to block inwardly rectifying potassium channels). Our patch-clamp data indicate that furosemide enhances the function of astrocytic, but not neuronal, inward potassium channels and that this modulation may be required for its antiepileptic activity. Although a variety of antiepileptic drugs are already available, none of these compounds selectively target astrocytes while preserving synaptic/neuronal function. Thus, furosemide-mediated modulation of inward potassium current (on astrocytes) represents a new target for control of abnormal electrical discharge in the CNS.},

  Abstract                 = {Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and astrocytes constitute macroglia. This review deals with the recent progress related to the origin and differentiation of the oligodendrocytes, their relationships to other neural cells, and functional neuroglial interactions under physiological conditions and in demyelinating diseases. One of the problems in studies of the CNS is to find components, i.e., markers, for the identification of the different cells, in intact tissues or cultures. In recent years, specific biochemical, immunological, and molecular markers have been identified. Many components specific to differentiating oligodendrocytes and to myelin are now available to aid their study. Transgenic mice and spontaneous mutants have led to a better understanding of the targets of specific dys- or demyelinating diseases. The best examples are the studies concerning the effects of the mutations affecting the most abundant protein in the central nervous myelin, the proteolipid protein, which lead to dysmyelinating diseases in animals and human (jimpy mutation and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease or spastic paraplegia, respectively). Oligodendrocytes, as astrocytes, are able to respond to changes in the cellular and extracellular environment, possibly in relation to a glial network. There is also a remarkable plasticity of the oligodendrocyte lineage, even in the adult with a certain potentiality for myelin repair after experimental demyelination or human diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Uptake of K(+) released by axons during action potential propagation is a major function of astrocytes. Here, we demonstrate the importance of glial inward rectifying potassium channels (Kir) in regulating extracellular K(+) ([K(+)](o)) and axonal electrical activity in CNS white matter of the mouse optic nerve. Increasing optic nerve stimulation frequency from 1 Hz to 10-35 Hz for 120 s resulted in a rise in [K(+)](o) and consequent decay in the compound action potential (CAP), a measure of reduced axonal activity. On cessation of high frequency stimulation, rapid K(+) clearance resulted in a poststimulus [K(+)](o) undershoot, followed by a slow recovery of [K(+)](o) and the CAP, which were more protracted with increasing stimulation frequency. Blockade of Kir (100 $\mu$M BaCl(2)) slowed poststimulus recovery of [K(+)](o) and the CAP at all stimulation frequencies, indicating a primary function of glial Kir was redistributing K(+) to the extracellular space to offset active removal by Na(+)-K(+) pumps. At higher levels of axonal activity, Kir blockade also increased [K(+)](o) accumulation, exacerbating the decline in the CAP and impeding its subsequent recovery. In the Kir4.1-/- mouse, astrocytes displayed a marked reduction of inward currents and were severely depolarized, resulting in retarded [K(+)](o) regulation and reduced CAP. The results demonstrate the importance of glial Kir in K(+) spatial buffering and sustaining axonal activity in the optic nerve. Glial Kir have increasing importance in K(+) clearance at higher levels of axonal activity, helping to maintain the physiological [K(+)](o) ceiling and ensure the fidelity of signaling between the retina and brain.},

  Abstract                 = {We hypothesized that cation-dependent Cl- transport protein Na-K-Cl cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) plays a role in the disruption of ion homeostasis in cerebral ischemia. In the current study, a role for NKCC1 in neuronal death was elucidated in neurotoxicity induced by glutamate and oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Incubation of cortical neurons cultured for 14-15 d in vitro (DIV) with 100 microm glutamate for 24 hr resulted in 50\% cell death. Three hours of OGD followed by 21 hr of reoxygenation led to 70\% cell death. Inhibition of NMDA receptors with dizocilpine hydrogen maleate (1 microm) prevented both OGD- and glutamate-mediated cell death. Moreover, blocking of NKCC1 activity with bumetanide (5-10 microm) abolished glutamate- or OGD-induced neurotoxicity. Bumetanide was ineffective if added after 10-120 min of glutamate incubation or 3-6 hr of OGD treatment. Accumulation of intracellular Na+ and 36Cl content after NMDA receptor activation was inhibited by bumetanide. Blockage of NKCC1 significantly attenuated cell swelling after OGD or NMDA receptor activation. This neuroprotection was age dependent. Inhibition of NKCC1 did not protect DIV 7-8 neurons against OGD-mediated cell death. In contrast, cell death in DIV 7-8 neurons was prevented by the protein-synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Taken together, the results suggest that NKCC1 activity is involved in the acute excitotoxicity as a result of excessive Na+ and Cl- entry and disruption of ion homeostasis.},

  Abstract                 = {Application of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol to astrocytes in situ or in vitro results in a receptor-mediated Cl(-) current with a concomitant block of outward K(+) currents. The effect on K(+) current is largely selective for the inactivating A-type current. Parallel experiments with various Cl(-) pipette concentrations show a significant reduction in A-type current under low Cl(-) conditions with minimal effect on delayed current. In addition, lower Cl(-) conditions caused a depolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation (V(1/2), -68 to -57 mV) and activation (V(1/2), -5.8 to 34 mV) kinetics of A-type current only. Cl(-) had no effect on the time course of inactivation or reactivation kinetics, suggesting the Cl(-)-mediated effect is largely on activation kinetics, indirectly affecting steady-state inactivation. Muscimol application to astrocytes under perforated patch control (gramicidin) displayed a similar block of A-type current to that of conventional whole cell patch at 40 or 20 mM pipette Cl(-) concentrations. With barium application under perforated patch conditions, the study of muscimol-mediated Cl(-) current in isolation of the effect on K(+) currents was possible. This allowed estimation of intracellular Cl(-) concentration from receptor current reversal information. The average intracellular Cl(-) concentration was found to be 29 +/- 3.2 mM. The effect on activation kinetics and lack of effect on time course of inactivation or reactivation suggest that intracellular anion concentrations have an effect on the K(+) channel voltage sensor region. Cl(-) may modulate K(+) currents by altering membrane field potentials surrounding K(+) channel proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {In the preceding paper (Bevensee, M.O., R.A. Weed, and W.F. Boron. 1997. 110: 453-465.), we showed that a Na-driven influx of HCO causes the increase in intracellular pH (pH) observed when astrocytes cultured from rat hippocampus are exposed to 5\% CO/17 mM HCO. In the present study, we used the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator 2',7'-biscarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and the perforated patch-clamp technique to determine whether this transporter is a Na-driven Cl-HCO exchanger, an electrogenic Na/HCO cotransporter, or an electroneutral Na/HCO cotransporter. To determine if the transporter is a Na-driven Cl-HCO exchanger, we depleted the cells of intracellular Cl by incubating them in a Cl-free solution for an average of approximately 11 min. We verified the depletion with the Cl-sensitive dye -(6-methoxyquinolyl)acetoethyl ester (MQAE). In Cl-depleted cells, the pH still increases after one or more exposures to CO/HCO. Furthermore, the pH decrease elicited by external Na removal does not require external Cl. Therefore, the transporter cannot be a Na-driven Cl-HCO exchanger. To determine if the transporter is an electrogenic Na/ HCO cotransporter, we measured pH and plasma membrane voltage (V) while removing external Na, in the presence/absence of CO/HCO and in the presence/absence of 400 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS). The CO/HCO solutions contained 20\% CO and 68 mM HCO, pH 7.3, to maximize the HCO flux. In pH experiments, removing external Na in the presence of CO/HCO elicited an equivalent HCO efflux of 281 microM s. The HCO influx elicited by returning external Na was inhibited 63\% by DIDS, so that the predicted DIDS-sensitive V change was 3.3 mV. Indeed, we found that removing external Na elicited a DIDS-sensitive depolarization that was 2.6 mV larger in the presence than in the absence of CO/ HCO. Thus, the Na/HCO cotransporter is electrogenic. Because a cotransporter with a Na:HCO stoichiometry of 1:3 or higher would predict a net HCO efflux, rather than the required influx, we conclude that rat hippocampal astrocytes have an electrogenic Na/HCO cotransporter with a stoichiometry of 1:2.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular diffusion in the brain extracellular space (ECS) is an important determinant of neural function. We developed a brain surface photobleaching method to measure the diffusion of fluorescently labeled macromolecules in the ECS of the cerebral cortex. The ECS in mouse brain was labeled by exposure of the intact dura to fluorescein-dextrans (M(r) 4, 70, and 500 kDa). Fluorescein-dextran diffusion, detected by fluorescence recovery after laser-induced cortical photobleaching using confocal optics, was slowed approximately threefold in the brain ECS relative to solution. Cytotoxic brain edema (produced by water intoxication) or seizure activity (produced by convulsants) slowed diffusion by >10-fold and created dead-space microdomains in which free diffusion was prevented. The hindrance to diffusion was greater for the larger fluorescein-dextrans. Interestingly, slowed ECS diffusion preceded electroencephalographic seizure activity. In contrast to the slowed diffusion produced by brain edema and seizure activity, diffusion in the ECS was faster in mice lacking aquaporin-4 (AQP4), an astroglial water channel that facilitates fluid movement between cells and the ECS. Our results establish a minimally invasive method to quantify diffusion in the brain ECS in vivo, revealing stimulus-induced changes in molecular diffusion in the ECS with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The in vivo mouse data provide evidence for: (1) dead-space ECS microdomains after brain swelling; (2) slowed molecular diffusion in the ECS as an early predictor of impending seizure activity; and (3) a novel role for AQP4 as a regulator of brain ECS.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain abscess is associated with local vasogenic edema, which leads to increased intracranial pressure and significant morbidity. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water channel expressed in astroglia at the blood-brain and brain-CSF barriers. To investigate the role of AQP4 in brain abscess-associated edema, live Staphylococcus aureus (10(5) colony-forming units) was injected into the striatum to create a focal abscess. Wild-type and AQP4-deficient mice had comparable immune responses as measured by brain abscess volume (approximately 3.7 mm3 at 3 days), bacterial count and cytokine levels in brain homogenates. Blood-brain barrier permeability was increased comparably in both groups as assessed by extravasation of Evans blue dye. However, at 3 days the AQP4 null mice had significantly higher intracranial pressure (mean +/- SEM 27 +/- 2 vs. 17 +/- 2 mmHg; p < 0.001) and brain water content (81.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 79.3 +/- 0.5 \% water by weight in the abscess-containing hemisphere; p < 0.01) than wild-type mice. Reactive astrogliosis was found throughout the abscess-containing hemisphere; however, only a subset of astrocytes in the peri-abscess region of wild-type mice had increased AQP4 immunoreactivity. Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of AQP4 on brain swelling in bacterial abscess, suggesting that AQP4 induction may reduce vasogenic edema associated with cerebral infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Ephaptic coupling refers to interactions between neurons mediated by current flow through the extracellular space. Ephaptic interactions between axons are considered negligible, because of the relatively large extracellular space and the layers of myelin that separate most axons. By contrast, olfactory nerve axons are unmyelinated and arranged in tightly packed bundles, features that may enhance ephaptic coupling. We tested the hypothesis that ephaptic interactions occur in the mammalian olfactory nerve with the use of a computational approach. Numerical solutions of models of axon fascicles show that significant ephaptic interactions occur for a range of physiologically relevant parameters. An action potential in a single axon can evoke action potentials in all other axons in the fascicle. Ephaptic interactions can also lead to synchronized firing of independently stimulated axons. Our findings suggest that ephaptic interactions may be significant determinants of the olfactory code and that such interactions may occur in other, similarly organized axonal or dendritic bundles.},

  Abstract                 = {Neocortical freeze lesions have been widely used to study neuronal mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability in dysplastic cortex. Comparatively little attention has been given to biophysical changes in the surrounding astrocytes that show profound morphological and biochemical alterations, often referred to as reactive gliosis. Astrocytes are thought to aid normal neuronal function by buffering extracellular K(+). Compromised astrocytic K(+) buffering has been proposed to contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Astrocytic K(+) buffering is mediated, partially, by the activity of inwardly rectifying K(+) channels (K(IR)) and may involve intracellular redistribution of K(+) through gap-junctions. We characterized K(+) channel expression and gap-junction coupling between astrocytes in freeze-lesion-induced dysplastic neocortex. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from astrocytes in slices from postnatal day (P) 16--P24 rats that had received a freeze-lesion on P1. A marked increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was observed along the entire length of the freeze lesion. Clusters of proliferative (bromo-deoxyuridine nuclear staining, BrdU+) astrocytes were seen near the depth of the microsulcus. Astrocytes in cortical layer I surrounding the lesion were characterized by a significant reduction in K(IR). BrdU-positive astrocytes near the depth of the microsulcus showed essentially no expression of K(IR) channels but markedly enhanced expression of delayed rectifier K(+) (K(DR)) channels. These proliferative cells showed virtually no dye coupling, whereas astrocytes in the hyperexcitable zone adjacent to the microsulcus displayed prominent dye-coupling as well as large K(IR) and outward K(+) currents. These findings suggest that reactive gliosis is accompanied by a loss of K(IR) currents and reduced gap junction coupling, which in turn suggests a compromised K(+) buffering capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied physiological properties of glial cells from acute slices of biopsies from patients operated for intractable mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Cells were filled with Lucifer Yellow (LY) during recordings to allow morphological reconstruction and immunohistochemical cell identification. Seizure-associated astrocytes had complex, arborized, highly branched processes giving them a stellate appearance, and cells stained intensely for the intermediate filament GFAP as previously reported for 'reactive' astrocytes. GFAP-positive astrocytes from epilepsy biopsies consistently expressed voltage-activated, TTX-sensitive Na+ channels that showed fast activation and inactivation kinetics. Unlike comparison astrocytes, derived from tissues that were not associated with seizure foci, these astrocytes expressed Na+ channels at densities sufficient to generate slow action potentials (spikes) in current clamp studies. In these cells, the ratio of Na+ to K+ conductance was consistently 3-4-fold higher than in comparison human or control rat astrocytes. Four of 17 astrocytes from epilepsy patients versus 14/14 from control rat hippocampus and four of five in comparison human tissue showed a lack of inwardly rectifying K+ currents, which in normal astrocytes are implicated in the control of extracellular K+ levels. These results suggest that astrocytes surrounding seizure foci differ in morphological and physiological properties, and that glial K+ buffering could be impaired at the seizure focus, thus contributing to the pathophysiology of seizures.},

  Abstract                 = {Together, the Na(+)-coupled HCO(3)(-) transporters and the AE family of anion exchangers (i.e., Cl-HCO3 exchangers) comprise the bicarbonate transporter (BT) superfamily. Virtually all BTs are important for the regulation of intracellular pH (pH(i)) in cells throughout the body. Specific BTs also play roles in cell-volume regulation, as well as for the transport of salt and/or acid-base equivalents across many epithelia. Electrogenic Na/HCO3 cotransporters (NBCe's) play key roles in HCO(3)(-) reabsorption by the renal proximal tubule, and HCO(3)(-) secretion by the pancreatic duct. Electroneutral NBC's (NBCn's) regulate pH(i) in vascular smooth muscle and are present in/near axons in the brain. Finally, the Na(+)-driven Cl-HCO3 exchanger (NDCBE's) appear to be the major pH(i) regulators in CNS neurons. A characteristic of most, but not all, BT's is that they are inhibited rather effectively by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-4,4'-disulfonate (DIDS).},

  Abstract                 = {Potassium (K+) channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) fulfill divergent roles in vertebrate nervous systems. Despite this, however, recent work suggests that these ion channels are structurally homologous, sharing an ancestral protein, architectural design, and tetrameric subunit stoichiometry. Their gating mechanisms also are speculated to have overlapping features. Here we show that the mechanism of iGluR desensitization is unique. Unlike K+ channels, AMPA- and kainate-type iGluR subunits desensitize in several ordered conformational steps. AMPA receptors operate as dimers, whereas the functional stoichiometry of kainate receptor desensitization is dependent on external ions. Contrary to conventional understanding, kinetic models suggest that partially desensitized AMPA and kainate receptors conduct ions and are likely participants in synaptic signaling. Although sharing many structural correlates with K+ channels, iGluRs have evolved unique subunit-subunit interactions, tailoring their gating behavior to fulfill distinct roles in neuronal signaling.},

  Abstract                 = {The export of glutamine from astrocytes, and the uptake of glutamine by neurons, are integral steps in the glutamate-glutamine cycle, a major pathway for the replenishment of neuronal glutamate. We review here the functional and molecular identification of the transporters that mediate this transfer. The emerging picture of glutamine transfer in adult brain is of a dominant pathway mediated by system N transport (SN1) in astrocytes and system A transport (SAT/ATA) in neurons. The participating glutamine transporters are functionally and structurally related, sharing the following properties: (a) unlike many neutral amino acid transporters which have proven to be obligate exchangers, these glutamine transporters mediate net substrate transfer energized by coupling to ionic gradients; (b) they are sensitive to small pH changes in the physiological range; (c) they are susceptible to adaptive and humoral regulation; (d) they are related structurally to the AAAP (amino acid and auxin permeases) family of transporters. A key difference between SN1 and the SAT/ATA transporters is the ready reversibility of glutamine fluxes via SN1 under physiological conditions, which allows SN1 both to sustain a glutamine concentration gradient in astrocytes and to mediate the net outward flux of glutamine. It is likely that the ASCT2 transporter, an obligate exchanger of neutral amino acids, displaces the SN1 transporter as the main carrier of glutamine export in proliferating astrocytes.},

  Abstract                 = {Under normal conditions, the pigment epithelium dehydrates the outer retina while M\"{u}ller glial cells mediate the rapid water transport within the inner retina. Gliotic alterations of M\"{u}ller cells may be implicated in the development of oedema in the post-ischaemic retina. Here, we suggest a mechanism of M\"{u}ller cell-supported neuronal cell swelling and apoptosis in the ischaemic retina. During ischaemia, over-excitation of ionotropic glutamate receptors leads to neuronal cell depolarization that causes excess Ca(2+) influx into the cells, and to activation of the apoptosis machinery. The ion fluxes into the retinal neurons are associated with water movements that are mediated by aquaporin-4 water channels expressed by M\"{u}ller cells and result in neuronal cell swelling. After reperfusion, the glial cells may swell due to the down-regulation of their K(+) conductance, which results in intracellular K(+) overload and water movements from the blood and vitreous into the cells. An inhibition of the glial cell-mediated water movements during ischaemic episodes should reduce the ion shifts at the neuronal synapses, resulting in decreased neuronal cell swelling and apoptosis. An inhibition of the water movements in the post-ischaemic phase may prevent cytotoxic M\"{u}ller cell swelling but may impair the fluid clearance from retinal tissue in the presence of vasogenic oedema. Thus, pharmacological modification of the ion and fluid clearance functions of M\"{u}ller cells may become a novel way to resolve both cytotoxic and vasogenic oedema in the retina.},

abstract = {There has been a revived interest in the impact of electric fields on neurons and networks. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how endogenous and externally imposed electric fields impact brain function at different spatial (from synapses to single neurons and neural networks) and temporal scales (from milliseconds to seconds). How such ephaptic effects are mediated and manifested in the brain remains a mystery. We argue that it is both possible (based on available technologies) and worthwhile to vigorously pursue such research as it has significant implications on our understanding of brain processing and for translational neuroscience.},

@article{Goldwyn2016,
abstract = {The ongoing activity of neurons generates a spatially and time-varying field of extracellular voltage (Ve). This Ve field reflects populationlevel neural activity, but does it modulate neural dynamics and the function of neural circuits? We provide a cable theory framework to study how a bundle of model neurons generates Ve and how this Ve feeds back and influences membrane potential (Vm). We find that these "ephaptic interactions" are small but not negligible. The model neural population can generate Ve with millivolt-scale amplitude, and this Ve perturbs the Vm of "nearby" cables and effectively increases their electrotonic length. After using passive cable theory to systematically study ephaptic coupling, we explore a test case: the medial superior olive (MSO) in the auditory brain stem. The MSO is a possible locus of ephaptic interactions: sounds evoke large (millivolt scale) Ve in vivo in this nucleus. The Ve response is thought to be generated by MSO neurons that perform a known neuronal computation with submillisecond temporal precision (coincidence detection to encode sound source location). Using a biophysically based model of MSO neurons, we find millivolt-scale ephaptic interactions consistent with the passive cable theory results. These subtle membrane potential perturbations induce changes in spike initiation threshold, spike time synchrony, and time difference sensitivity. These results suggest that ephaptic coupling may influence MSO function.},

  Abstract                 = {A variety of pathological conditions lead to swelling of astrocytes, which in turn stimulates ion release by activation of ion channels at the plasma membrane. In the present study, acridine orange and fluorescein isothiocyanate coupled to dextran (FITC-dextran) have been used to examine the effect of cell swelling on pH in acidic compartments of cultured astroglial cells. Both NH4Cl (2 mM) and chloroquine (10 microM), known to alkalinize acidic cellular compartments, led to the expected increase in acridine orange fluorescence intensity. Similar, albeit smaller, effects were elicited by a reduction of extracellular osmolarity (-80 mOsm) and treatment of the cells with glutamate (l mM), manoeuvres which enhanced cell volume. Determination of changes in the FITC-dextran fluorescence ratio (485/440 nm) allowed quantification of the pH changes in lysosomal compartments. Treatment with NH4Cl, reduced extracellular osmolarity and glutamate increased lysosomal pH by 0.65 +/- 0.07, 0.85 +/- 0.14 and 0.25 +/- 0.07, respectively. Measurement of cytosolic pH using 2',7',-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5- (and -6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) demonstrated a pronounced acidification following cell swelling, observed with both reduced extracellular osmolarity (by 0.23 +/- 0.05 pH units) and 1 mM glutamate (by 0.26 +/- 0.02 pH units). In conclusion, pH within lysosomes and possibly other acidic cellular compartments of astrocytes is increased by cell swelling, which may have important consequences for astrocyte function.},

  Abstract                 = {Glia in the central nervous system (CNS) express diverse inward rectifying potassium channels (Kir). The major function of Kir is in establishing the high potassium (K+) selectivity of the glial cell membrane and strongly negative resting membrane potential (RMP), which are characteristic physiological properties of glia. The classical property of Kir is that K+ flows inwards when the RMP is negative to the equilibrium potential for K+ (E(K)), but at more positive potentials outward currents are inhibited. This provides the driving force for glial uptake of K+ released during neuronal activity, by the processes of "K+ spatial buffering" and "K+ siphoning", considered a key function of astrocytes, the main glial cell type in the CNS. Glia express multiple Kir channel subtypes, which are likely to have distinct functional roles related to their differences in conductance, and sensitivity to intracellular and extracellular factors, including pH, ATP, G-proteins, neurotransmitters and hormones. A feature of CNS glia is their specific expression of the Kir4.1 subtype, which is a major K+ conductance in glial cell membranes and has a key role in setting the glial RMP. It is proposed that Kir4.1 have a primary function in K+ regulation, both as homomeric channels and as heteromeric channels by co-assembly with Kir5.1 and probably Kir2.0 subtypes. Significantly, Kir4.1 are also expressed by oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the CNS, and the genetic ablation of Kir4.1 results in severe hypomyelination. Hence, Kir, and in particular Kir4.1, are key regulators of glial functions, which in turn determine neuronal excitability and axonal conduction.},

High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

  Abstract                 = {Heteromultimerization between different potassium channel subunits can generate channels with novel functional properties and thus contributes to the rich functional diversity of this gene family. The inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir5.1 exhibits highly selective heteromultimerization with Kir4.1 to generate heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels with unique rectification and kinetic properties. These novel channels are also inhibited by intracellular pH within the physiological range and are thought to play a key role in linking K+ and H+ homeostasis by the kidney. However, the mechanisms that control heteromeric K+ channel assembly and the structural elements that generate their unique functional properties are poorly understood. In this study we identify residues at an intersubunit interface between the cytoplasmic domains of Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 that influence the novel rectification and gating properties of heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels and that also contribute to their pH sensitivity. Furthermore, this interaction presents a structural mechanism for the functional coupling of these properties and explains how specific heteromeric interactions can contribute to the novel functional properties observed in heteromeric Kir channels. The highly conserved nature of this structural association between Kir subunits also has implications for understanding the general mechanisms of Kir channel gating and their regulation by intracellular pH.},

  Abstract                 = {With increasing longevity, the number of older schizophrenic patients is growing. Previous criteria used the age of symptom onset to differentiate between the late manifestations of early-onset schizophrenia and late-onset schizophreniform disorders. Current DSM-IV or ICD 10 nomenclatures do not differentiate between early- and late-onset schizophrenia. Many decades of repeated failures to provide for distinguishing neuropathological findings have prompted narrower definition criteria. Since psychotic or schizophreniform symptoms in old age may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, we attempted to base a distinction between both early- and late-onset schizophrenia on the presence of degenerative changes. This study examined the brains of 64 schizophrenic patients and 18 controls immunocytochemically for tau and amyloid staining. We divided patients according to their ages at the onset of symptoms: <40, >40. Using Braak's classification, we assessed the presence of neurofibrillary pathology. Stages III and IV were observed in 11.1\% (2/18) of controls, 36.7\% (11/30) of early-onset schizophrenics (<40) and 58.8\% (20/34) of late-onset (>40) schizophrenics (chi2=11.39, P =0.003). Stages V and VI (definite Alzheimer's disease) did not significantly differ among groups (chi2=3.6, P =0.165). Astrocytes, subependymal and fibroblastic, also exhibited tau-positive tangles. Chi-square analysis of the data revealed a significant association between tau-positive glial tangles and Braak staging ( P =0.002). Amyloid deposits were sparse in comparison to tau-related changes. The restricted limbic tauopathy not only affected a majority of patients with late-onset schizophrenia (19 female: 1 male among positive cases) ( P =0.048) but also appeared in one-third of those elderly schizophrenic patients whose symptom onset occurred before 40 years of age (8 female: 3 male among positive cases) ( P =0.048). The resultant changes define a type of neuronal cytoskeletal disruption that alters the flow of information through the hippocampus and provides a useful clinico-pathological correlate to a group of patients until recently diagnosed as schizophrenic.},

  Abstract                 = {Mature macroglia and almost all neural progenitor types express $\gamma$-aminobutyric (GABA) A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), whose activation by ambient or synaptic GABA, leads to influx or efflux of chloride (Cl(-)) depending on its electro-chemical gradient (E(Cl)). Since the flux of Cl(-) is indissolubly associated to that of osmotically obliged water, GABA(A)Rs regulate water movements by modulating ion gradients. In addition, since water movements also occur through specialized water channels and transporters, GABA(A)R signaling could affect the movement of water by regulating the function of the channels and transporters involved, thereby affecting not only the direction of the water fluxes but also their dynamics. We will here review recent observations indicating that in neural cells GABA(A)R-mediated osmotic regulation affects the cellular volume thereby activating multiple intracellular signaling mechanisms important for cell proliferation, maturation, and survival. In addition, we will discuss evidence that the osmotic regulation exerted by GABA may contribute to brain water homeostasis in physiological and in pathological conditions causing brain edema, in which the GABAergic transmission is often altered.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite intense study, the precise origin and cell lineage of microglia, the resident mononuclear phagocytes of the nervous system, are still a matter for debate. Unlike macroglia (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and neurons, which are derived from neuroectoderm, microglial progenitors arise from peripheral mesodermal (myeloid) tissue. The view still commonly held is that tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes (including microglia) are derived from circulating blood monocytes and these take up residence late in gestation and postnatally. However, microglial progenitors colonise the nervous system primarily during embryonic and fetal periods of development. Recent evidence indicates differences between the lineage of mononuclear phagocytes during the embryonic and fetal period from that in the neonate and adult-mononuclear phagocytes that take up residence within tissues are derived from a lineage of myeloid cells that is independent of the monocyte lineage. Our own findings on the development and differentiation of microglial progenitors, taken together with findings by other investigators, and in the context of the heterogeneity between myeloid differentiation in the fetus and in the adult, support the view that microglia are derived prenatally from mesodermal progenitors that are distinct from monocytes. Furthermore, microglial progenitors colonise the nervous system via extravascular routes initially. These findings challenge the concept that resident microglia in the nervous system are derived from circulating blood monocytes. Work is still underway to establish the tissue of origin and lineage of microglial progenitors in vivo. This information is critical not only from a developmental perspective, but significantly from a therapeutic viewpoint, as (i) the unique property of microglial progenitors to colonise the nervous system from the periphery allows these cells to be exploited as a biological and non-invasive means for cell therapy by delivering genes to the nervous system (microglial engraftment), and (ii) there are indications that microglial progenitors are specifically able to home to the nervous system. Use of microglial progenitors for therapeutic purposes becomes feasible only if the origin and cell lineage of these microglial progenitors are known and these cells can be isolated and manipulated in vitro (i.e., to express specific trophic factors) prior to therapeutic transfer (e.g., intravenously) in vivo. In this paper, we shall briefly consider the existing concepts on the origin and lineage of microglial progenitors and discuss new hypotheses in the light of emerging data that suggest clear differences between fetal and adult ontogeny of myeloid cells.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a computational, biophysical model of neuron-astrocyte-vessel interaction. Unlike other cells, neurons convey "hunger" signals to the vascular network via an intervening layer of glial cells (astrocytes); vessels dilate and release glucose which fuels neuronal firing. Existing computational models focus on only parts of this loop (neuron→astrocyte→vessel→neuron), whereas the proposed model describes the entire loop. Neuronal firing causes release of a neurotransmitter like glutamate which triggers release of vasodilator by astrocytes via a cascade of biochemical events. Vasodilators released from astrocytic endfeet cause blood vessels to dilate and release glucose into the interstitium, part of which is taken up by the astrocyticendfeet. Glucose is converted into lactate in the astrocyte and transported into the neuron. Glucose from the interstitium and lactate (produced from glucose) influx from astrocyte are converted into ATP in the neuron. Neuronal ATP is used to drive the Na(+)/K(+)ATPase pumps, which maintain ionic gradients necessary for neuronal firing. When placed in the metabolic loop, the neuron exhibits sustained firing only when the stimulation current is more than a minimum threshold. For various combinations of initial neuronal [ATP] and external current, the neuron exhibits a variety of firing patterns including sustained firing, firing after an initial pause, burst firing etc. Neurovascular interactions under conditions of constricted vessels are also studied. Most models of cerebral circulation describe neurovascular interactions exclusively in the "forward" neuron→vessel direction. The proposed model indicates possibility of "reverse" influence also, with vasomotion rhythms influencing neural firing patterns. Another idea that emerges out of the proposed work is that brain's computations may be more comprehensively understood in terms of neuro-glial-vascular dynamics and not in terms of neural firing alone.},

  Abstract                 = {It has long been assumed that one important mechanism for the dissipation of local potassium gradients in the brain extracellular space is the so-called spatial buffer, generally associated with glial cells. To date, however, there has been no analytical description of the characteristic patterns of K(+) clearance mediated by such a mechanism. This study reanalyzed a mathematical model of Gardner-Medwin (1983, J. Physiol. (Lond.). 335:393-426) that had previously been solved numerically. Under suitable approximations, the transient solutions for the potassium concentrations and the corresponding membrane potentials of glial cells in a finite, parallel domain were derived. The analytic results were substantiated by numerical simulations of a detailed two-compartment model. This simulation explored the dependence of spatial buffer current and extracellular K(+) on the distribution of inward rectifier K(+) channels in the glial endfoot and nonendfoot membranes, the glial geometric length, and the effect of passive KCl uptake. Regarding the glial cells as an equivalent leaky cable, the analyses indicated that a maximum endfoot current occurs when the glial geometric length is equal to the corresponding electrotonic space constant. Consequently, a long glial process is unsuitable for spatial buffering, unless the axial space constant can match the length of the process. Finally, this study discussed whether the spatial buffer mechanism is able to efficiently transport K(+) over distances of more than several glial space constants.},

  Abstract                 = {The regulation of pH is a vital homeostatic function shared by all tissues. Mechanisms that govern H+ in the intracellular and extracellular fluid are especially important in the brain, because electrical activity can elicit rapid pH changes in both compartments. These acid-base transients may in turn influence neural activity by affecting a variety of ion channels. The mechanisms responsible for the regulation of intracellular pH in brain are similar to those of other tissues and are comprised principally of forms of Na+/H+ exchange, Na+-driven Cl-/HCO3- exchange, Na+-HCO3- cotransport, and passive Cl-/HCO3- exchange. Differences in the expression or efficacy of these mechanisms have been noted among the functionally and morphologically diverse neurons and glial cells that have been studied. Molecular identification of transporter isoforms has revealed heterogeneity among brain regions and cell types. Neural activity gives rise to an assortment of extracellular and intracellular pH shifts that originate from a variety of mechanisms. Intracellular pH shifts in neurons and glia have been linked to Ca2+ transport, activation of acid extrusion systems, and the accumulation of metabolic products. Extracellular pH shifts can occur within milliseconds of neural activity, arise from an assortment of mechanisms, and are governed by the activity of extracellular carbonic anhydrase. The functional significance of these compartmental, activity-dependent pH shifts is discussed.},

Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.},

At stimulus charge densities shown to induce only minimal localized histologic changes [20 μC/cm2·ph at 50 pulses per second (pps)], [K+]0 at a depth of about 750 μm underwent only a transient increase at the beginning of stimulation, followed by a rapid return to the prestimulus concentration. [Ca2+]0 was unaffected. At a higher charge density (100 μC/cm2·ph at 20 pps) there was a rapid transient increase in [K+]0, followed by a more gradual return to a plateau about 1 mm above the prestimulus value. [Ca2+]0 usually underwent an initial increase followed by a slow decrease to a plateau value above 0.5 mm. At a charge density of 100 μC/cm2·ph and 50 pps (shown in histological studies to induce significant neural damage), [Ca2+]0 slowly decreased to near or below 0.5 mm in the middle layers of the cortex. After 30 to 40 min of stimulation, [K+]0 underwent episodic fluctuations about a plateau value 0.5 to 1 mm above the prestimulus concentration. Simultaneous recordings of the compound action potential in the ipsilateral pyramidal tract indicated that these fluctuations were due to local changes in the excitability of intracortical circuitry conditioned by the intense stimulation. The results have implications for the possible interrelation of the changes in extracellular ionic concentrations and the early stages of stimulation-induced neural damage."

  Abstract                 = {One of the major physiological roles of potassium channels in glial cells is to promote "potassium spatial buffering" in the central nervous system, a process necessary to maintain an optimal potassium concentration in the extracellular environment. This process requires the precise distribution of potassium channels accumulated at high density in discrete subdomains of glial cell membranes. To obtain a better understanding of how glial cells selectively target potassium channels to discrete membrane subdomains, we addressed the question of whether the glial inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 associates with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Kir4.1 is associated with the DGC in mouse brain and cultured cortical astrocytes. In vitro immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays demonstrated that Kir4.1 can bind directly to alpha-syntrophin, requiring the presence of the last three amino acids of the channel (SNV), a consensus PDZ domain-binding motif. Furthermore, Kir4.1 failed to associate with the DGC in brains from alpha-syntrophin knockout mice. These results suggest that Kir4.1 is localized in glial cells by its association with the DGC through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction with alpha-syntrophin and suggest an important role for the DGC in central nervous system physiology.},

  Abstract                 = {In these companion papers, we study how the interrelated dynamics of sodium and potassium affect the excitability of neurons, the occurrence of seizures, and the stability of persistent states of activity. In this first paper, we construct a mathematical model consisting of a single conductance-based neuron together with intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics. We formulate a reduction of this model that permits a detailed bifurcation analysis, and show that the reduced model is a reasonable approximation of the full model. We find that competition between intrinsic neuronal currents, sodium-potassium pumps, glia, and diffusion can produce very slow and large-amplitude oscillations in ion concentrations similar to what is seen physiologically in seizures. Using the reduced model, we identify the dynamical mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena. These models reveal several experimentally testable predictions. Our work emphasizes the critical role of ion concentration homeostasis in the proper functioning of neurons, and points to important fundamental processes that may underlie pathological states such as epilepsy.},

  Abstract                 = {Several inward rectifier K(+) (Kir) channels are pH-sensitive, making them potential candidates for CO(2) chemoreception in cells. However, there is no evidence showing that Kir channels change their activity at near physiological level of P(CO(2)), as most previous studies were done using high concentrations of CO(2). It is known that the heteromeric Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels are highly sensitive to intracellular protons with pKa value right at the physiological pH level. Such a pKa value may allow these channels to regulate membrane potentials with modest changes in P(CO(2)). To test this hypothesis, we studied the Kir4.1-Kir5.1 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes and membrane potentials in the presence and absence of bicarbonate. Evident inhibition of these currents (by approximately 5\%) was seen with P(CO(2)) as low as 8 torr. Higher P(CO(2)) levels (23-60 torr) produced stronger inhibitions (by 30-40\%). The inhibitions led to graded depolarizations (5-45 mV with P(CO(2)) 8-60 torr). Similar effects were observed in the presence of 24 mM bicarbonate and 5\% CO(2). Indeed, the Kir4.1-Kir5.1 currents were enhanced with 3\% CO(2) and suppressed with 8\% CO(2) in voltage clamp, resulting in hyper- (-9 mV) and depolarization (16 mV) in current clamp, respectively. With physiological concentration of extracellular K(+), the Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels conduct substantial outward currents that were similarly inhibited by CO(2) as their inward rectifying currents. These results therefore indicate that the heteromeric Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels are modulated by a modest change in P(CO(2)) levels. Such a modulation alters cellular excitability, and enables the cell to detect hypercapnia and hypocapnia in the presence of bicarbonate.},

  Abstract                 = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be associated with memory impairment, cognitive deficits, or seizures, all of which can reflect altered hippocampal function. Whereas previous studies have focused on the involvement of neuronal loss in post-traumatic hippocampus, there has been relatively little understanding of changes in ionic homeostasis, failure of which can result in neuronal hyperexcitability and abnormal synchronization. Because glia play a crucial role in the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment, we investigated the effects of TBI on rat hippocampal glia. Using a fluid percussion injury (FPI) model and patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal slices, we have found impaired glial physiology 2 d after FPI. Electrophysiologically, we observed reduction in transient outward and inward K(+) currents. To assess the functional consequences of these glial changes, field potentials and extracellular K(+) activity were recorded in area CA3 during antidromic stimulation. An abnormal extracellular K(+) accumulation was observed in the post-traumatic hippocampal slices, accompanied by the appearance of CA3 afterdischarges. After pharmacological blockade of excitatory synapses and of K(+) inward currents, uninjured slices showed the same altered K(+) accumulation in the absence of abnormal neuronal activity. We suggest that TBI causes loss of K(+) conductance in hippocampal glia that results in the failure of glial K(+) homeostasis, which in turn promotes abnormal neuronal function. These findings provide a new potential mechanistic link between traumatic brain injury and subsequent development of disorders such as memory loss, cognitive decline, seizures, and epilepsy.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes have been suggested to play several roles in the complex control of brain microenvironment. However, they have been generally considered to constitute a homogeneous population of cells. Here we show that at least three electrophysiologically distinct types of astrocytes can be found in the mature hippocampus. These subpopulations of glia were characterized by expression of different ion currents. In astrocytes exposed to elevated K+, Cs+ prevented influx of K+ only in cells with inwardly rectifying currents (IIR). The topographic distribution of glia with Cs+-sensitive inward rectifying currents (involved in K+ buffering) was nonuniform. Cs+-sensitive astrocytes were predominantly found in CA3 radiatum, whereas most CA1 astrocytes were Cs+-insensitive. Functional significance of the spatial segregation of glial cells with inward rectification was addressed in slices that were bathed in Cs+-containing media. Under these conditions, neuronal stimulation induced spontaneous epileptiform activity, which first appeared in CA3 and was then synaptically propagated to CA1. Intracellular labeling of astrocytes with biocytin revealed that CA1 astrocytes are characterized by a high degree of cell-to-cell coupling; in contrast, cell labeling in CA3 revealed smaller groups and occasionally individual cells. Three individual biocytin-labeled cells had electrophysiological properties indistinguishable from Cs+-sensitive astrocytes but had morphology typical of oligodendroglia. These results provide evidence for a role of K+ uptake via IIR into astrocytes. The segregated expression of potassium channels in a subpopulation of astrocytes suggests that functionally specialized cell types are involved in K+ homeostasis.},

  Abstract                 = {The secretory Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC1 is activated by secretagogues through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. We found a phosphorylation stoichiometry of 3.0 +/- 0.4 phosphorylated residues/NKCC1 protein harvested from shark rectal gland tubules maximally stimulated with forskolin and calyculin A, showing that at least three sites on the cotransporter are phosphorylated upon stimulation. Three phosphoacceptor sites were identified in the N-terminal domain of the protein (at Thr(184), Thr(189), and Thr(202)) using high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze tryptic fragments of the radiolabeled cotransporter. None of these residues occurs in the context of strong consensus sites for known Ser/Thr kinases. The threonines and the surrounding amino acids are highly conserved between NKCC1 and NKCC2, and similarities are also present in the Na-Cl cotransporter NCC (or TSC). This strongly suggests that the phosphoregulatory mechanism is conserved among isoforms. Through expression of shark NKCC1 mutants in HEK-293 cells, Thr(189) was found to be necessary for activation of the protein, whereas phosphorylation at Thr(184) and Thr(202) was modulatory, but not required. In conjunction with the recent finding (Darmen, R. B., Flemmer, A., and Forbush, B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 34359-34362) that protein phosphatase-1 binds to residues 107-112 in the shark NKCC1 sequence, these results demonstrate that the N terminus of NKCC1 constitutes a phosphoregulatory domain of the transporter.},

Computational modeling is challenged by the fact that many details remain hitherto unknown and conventional approaches to describe synaptic function are unsuitable to explain experimental observations when astrocytic signaling is taken into account. Supported by experimental evidence is the possibility that astrocytes perform genuine information processing by means of their calcium signaling and are players in the physiological setting of the basal tone of synaptic transmission. Here we consider the plausibility of this scenario from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the modulation of synaptic release probability by the astrocyte and its implications on synaptic plasticity. The analysis of the signaling pathways underlying such modulation refines our notion of tripartite synapse and has profound implications on our understanding of brain function.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes communicate with synapses by means of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) elevations, but local calcium dynamics in astrocytic processes have never been thoroughly investigated. By taking advantage of high-resolution two-photon microscopy, we identify the characteristics of local astrocyte calcium activity in the adult mouse hippocampus. Astrocytic processes showed intense activity, triggered by physiological transmission at neighboring synapses. They encoded synchronous synaptic events generated by sparse action potentials into robust regional (∼12 $\mu$m) [Ca(2+)](i) elevations. Unexpectedly, they also sensed spontaneous synaptic events, producing highly confined (∼4 $\mu$m), fast (millisecond-scale) miniature Ca(2+) responses. This Ca(2+) activity in astrocytic processes is generated through GTP- and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent signaling and is relevant for basal synaptic function. Thus, buffering astrocyte [Ca(2+)](i) or blocking a receptor mediating local astrocyte Ca(2+) signals decreased synaptic transmission reliability in minimal stimulation experiments. These data provide direct evidence that astrocytes are integrated in local synaptic functioning in adult brain.},

The simulations showed, in agreement with the experimental findings, that the intracellular calcium fluxes mediated by the P2X and P2Y purinoreceptors are responsible for the biphasic ATP evoked calcium response in astrocytes. Then, the modulation effects on the neural dynamics arising from the release of glutamate from astrocyte are also investigated. By using a minimal network model describing a neuron coupled to the astrocyte, we demonstrated that the calcium extrusion rate through the astrocyte membrane is critically involved in the generation of different firing patterns of the neuron.},

  Abstract                 = {During neuronal activity, extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]out) becomes elevated and, if uncorrected, causes neuronal depolarization, hyperexcitability, and seizures. Clearance of K+ from the extracellular space, termed K+ spatial buffering, is considered to be an important function of astrocytes. Results from a number of studies suggest that maintenance of [K+]out by astrocytes is mediated by K+ uptake through the inward-rectifying Kir4.1 channels. To study the role of this channel in astrocyte physiology and neuronal excitability, we generated a conditional knock-out (cKO) of Kir4.1 directed to astrocytes via the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter gfa2. Kir4.1 cKO mice die prematurely and display severe ataxia and stress-induced seizures. Electrophysiological recordings revealed severe depolarization of both passive astrocytes and complex glia in Kir4.1 cKO hippocampal slices. Complex cell depolarization appears to be a direct consequence of Kir4.1 removal, whereas passive astrocyte depolarization seems to arise from an indirect developmental process. Furthermore, we observed a significant loss of complex glia, suggestive of a role for Kir4.1 in astrocyte development. Kir4.1 cKO passive astrocytes displayed a marked impairment of both K+ and glutamate uptake. Surprisingly, membrane and action potential properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, as well as basal synaptic transmission in the CA1 stratum radiatum appeared unaffected, whereas spontaneous neuronal activity was reduced in the Kir4.1 cKO. However, high-frequency stimulation revealed greatly elevated posttetanic potentiation and short-term potentiation in Kir4.1 cKO hippocampus. Our findings implicate a role for glial Kir4.1 channel subunit in the modulation of synaptic strength.},

  Abstract                 = {Glial cell Na,K-ATPase is suggested to participate in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) control by being activated when [K+]o rises in the brain. The extent of that activation directly depends on the Na/K pump affinity to [K+]o, intracellular Na+ ([Na+]i) and, indirectly on pump cycle regulation by membrane potential (Vm). In the present investigation, these Na/K pump properties were studied with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in cultured mouse oligodendrocytes (N20.1 cell line). N20.1 cells possess ouabain-sensitive Na/K pump current (Ip) with a maximal density of 0.5-0.6 pA/pF (estimated for conditions of Na/K pump stimulation by saturating [Na+]i, [ATP]i, [K+]o and at positive Vm). This current was half-inhibited at 83 +/- 31 microM ouabain, and half-activated by [Na+]i of 9.6 +/- 1.1 mM, by [K+]o of 2.0 +/- 0.1 mM and by membrane potential at about -65 mV. High levels of nervous activity may increase [K+]o from 3 to 12 mM which would only increase Na/K pump current by 40\% due to the direct effect of [K+]o. However, elevated [K+]o would also depolarize the glial cell membrane which would indirectly activate Ip and together with the direct effect of [K+]o would increase Ip as much as 2-2.5-fold. These data suggest that glial cell Na/K pump regulation by Vm may be an important factor in determining the participation of the Na/K pump in [K+]o homeostasis in the nervous system.},

  Abstract                 = {ATP, released by both neurons and glia, is an important mediator of brain intercellular communication. We find that selective activation of purinergic P2Y1 receptors (P2Y1R) in cultured astrocytes triggers glutamate release. By total internal fluorescence reflection imaging of fluorescence-labeled glutamatergic vesicles, we document that such release occurs by regulated exocytosis. The stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism involves Ca2+ release from internal stores and is controlled by additional transductive events mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and prostaglandins (PG). P2Y1R activation induces release of both TNFalpha and PGE2 and blocking either one significantly reduces glutamate release. Accordingly, astrocytes from TNFalpha-deficient (TNF(-/-)) or TNF type 1 receptor-deficient (TNFR1(-/-)) mice display altered P2Y1R-dependent Ca2+ signaling and deficient glutamate release. In mixed hippocampal cultures, the P2Y1R-evoked process occurs in astrocytes but not in neurons or microglia. P2Y1R stimulation induces Ca2+ -dependent glutamate release also from acute hippocampal slices. The process in situ displays characteristics resembling those in cultured astrocytes and is distinctly different from synaptic glutamate release evoked by high K+ stimulation as follows: (a) it is sensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibitors; (b) it is deficient in preparations from TNF(-/-) and TNFR1(-/-) mice; and (c) it is inhibited by the exocytosis blocker bafilomycin A1 with a different time course. No glutamate release is evoked by P2Y1R-dependent stimulation of hippocampal synaptosomes. Taken together, our data identify the coupling of purinergic P2Y1R to glutamate exocytosis and its peculiar TNFalpha- and PG-dependent control, and we strongly suggest that this cascade operates selectively in astrocytes. The identified pathway may play physiological roles in glial-glial and glial-neuronal communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Chloride homeostasis is a critical determinant of the strength and robustness of inhibition mediated by GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). The impact of changes in steady state Cl(-) gradient is relatively straightforward to understand, but how dynamic interplay between Cl(-) influx, diffusion, extrusion and interaction with other ion species affects synaptic signaling remains uncertain. Here we used electrodiffusion modeling to investigate the nonlinear interactions between these processes. Results demonstrate that diffusion is crucial for redistributing intracellular Cl(-) load on a fast time scale, whereas Cl(-)extrusion controls steady state levels. Interaction between diffusion and extrusion can result in a somato-dendritic Cl(-) gradient even when KCC2 is distributed uniformly across the cell. Reducing KCC2 activity led to decreased efficacy of GABA(A)R-mediated inhibition, but increasing GABA(A)R input failed to fully compensate for this form of disinhibition because of activity-dependent accumulation of Cl(-). Furthermore, if spiking persisted despite the presence of GABA(A)R input, Cl(-) accumulation became accelerated because of the large Cl(-) driving force that occurs during spikes. The resulting positive feedback loop caused catastrophic failure of inhibition. Simulations also revealed other feedback loops, such as competition between Cl(-) and pH regulation. Several model predictions were tested and confirmed by [Cl(-)](i) imaging experiments. Our study has thus uncovered how Cl(-) regulation depends on a multiplicity of dynamically interacting mechanisms. Furthermore, the model revealed that enhancing KCC2 activity beyond normal levels did not negatively impact firing frequency or cause overt extracellular K(-) accumulation, demonstrating that enhancing KCC2 activity is a valid strategy for therapeutic intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of cytotoxic oedema during a stroke consists in cell swelling and shrinking of the extracellular space. This phenomenon is triggered by ion movements through voltage-gated channels, exchangers and pumps. During ischaemia, sodium, calcium and chloride enter the neurons whereas potassium and glutamate are expelled out of the cells. A mathematical model is proposed to represent the long-term dynamics of membrane potentials, cell volumes and ionic concentrations in intracellular and extracellular spaces during a stroke and to study the influence of each ionic current on cell swelling. The model relies on electrophysiological mechanisms and takes into account the behaviour of two types of cells: neurons and also astrocytes known to play a key role in the excitotoxic process in grey matter. The results obtained when a severe or a moderate ischaemia is simulated are consistent with those observed in the in vitro and in vivo experiments. As this model appears to be robust, it is used to perform illustrative simulations aimed at studying the effect of some channel blockers on cell swelling. This approach may help to explore new therapeutic strategies in order to reduce stroke damage.},

To help in integrating the available data, we decided to build a formal model. We first collected and categorised the major available evidence from animal models and human observations and summarized this knowledge in a flow-chart with the potential key components of an evolving stroke. Components were grouped in ten sub-models that could be modelled and tested independently: the sub-models of tissue reactions, ionic movements, oedema development, glutamate excitotoxicity, spreading depression, NO synthesis, inflammation, necrosis, apoptosis, and reperfusion. Then, we figured out markers, identified mediators and chose the level of complexity to model these sub-models. We first applied this integrative approach to build a model based on cytotoxic oedema development following a stroke. Although this model includes only three sub-models and would need to integrate more mechanisms in each of these sub-models, the characteristics and the time and spatial evolution of penumbra obtained by simulation are qualitatively and, to some extent, quantitatively consistent with those observed using medical imaging after a permanent occlusion or after an occlusion followed by a reperfusion.},

  Abstract                 = {The astrocytic response to stroke is extremely complex and incompletely understood. On the one hand, astrocytes are known to be neuroprotective when extracellular glutamate or potassium is slightly increased. But, on the other hand, they are considered to contribute to the extracellular glutamate increase during severe ischaemia. A mathematical model is used to reproduce the dynamics of the membrane potentials, intracellular and extracellular concentrations and volumes of neurons and astrocytes during ischaemia in order to study the role of astrocytes in grey matter during the first hour of a stroke. Under conditions of mild ischaemia, astrocytes are observed to take up glutamate via the glutamate transporter, and potassium via the Na/K/Cl cotransporter, which limits glutamate and potassium increase in the extracellular space. On the contrary, under conditions of severe ischaemia, astrocytes appear to be unable to maintain potassium homeostasis. Moreover, they are shown to contribute to the excitotoxicity process by expelling glutamate out of the cells via the reversed glutamate transporter. A detailed understanding of astrocytic function and influence on neuron survival during stroke is necessary to improve the neuroprotective strategies for stroke patients.},

  Abstract                 = {A molecular model of the excitatory postsynaptic membrane is given in terms of two biochemical cycles intimately associated: an acetylcholine cycle and a calcium cycle. The acetylcholine controls the Na ionophores while calcium ions control the tk ionophore. The two ionophores are spatially separated but interact in such a way that the variation in K conductance precedes that in Na conductance. Digital simulation shows that our model accounts quantitatively for both the evolution of excitatory postsynaptic potential and current in a variety of experimental conditions.},

Using electrophysiology together with sensitive volumetric measurements, we investigated the nature of the driving force behind the cotransporter-mediated water flux.

Addition of 5 mM alpha-methyl-glucose (alpha MG) induced an average inward current of 800 +/- 10 nA at -50 mV and a water influx reaching 120 +/- 20 pL cm(-2) x s(-1) within 5-8 min. After rapidly inhibiting the Na(+)/glucose cotransport with phlorizin, the water flux remained significantly elevated, clearly indicating the presence of a local osmotic gradient (Delta pi) estimated at 16 +/- 2 mOsm.

Although ionic concentration changes may not be significant in the time course of one action potential, they are important when considering the long-term behavior (seconds to minutes) of an axon. We demonstrate this point with simulations of transected axons where ions are moving between the intra- and extracellular spaces through an opening that is sealing with time. The model predicts that sealing must occur within a critical time interval after the initial injury to prevent the entire axon from becoming permanently depolarized. This critical time interval becomes considerably shorter when active ion transport is disabled. Furthermore, the model can be used to study the effects of sodium and potassium channel inactivation; e.g., sodium inactivation must be almost complete (within 0.02\%) to obtain simulation results that are realistic.},

  Abstract                 = {An abnormal accumulation of extracellular K+ in the brain has been implicated in the generation of seizures in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and hippocampal sclerosis. Experimental studies have shown that clearance of extracellular K+ is compromised by removal of the perivascular pool of the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4), suggesting that an efficient clearance of K+ depends on a concomitant water flux through astrocyte membranes. Therefore, we hypothesized that loss of perivascular AQP4 might be involved in the pathogenesis of MTLE. Whereas Western blot analysis showed an overall increase in AQP4 levels in MTLE compared with non-MTLE hippocampi, quantitative ImmunoGold electron microscopy revealed that the density of AQP4 along the perivascular membrane domain of astrocytes was reduced by 44\% in area CA1 of MTLE vs. non-MTLE hippocampi. There was no difference in the density of AQP4 on the astrocyte membrane facing the neuropil. Because anchoring of AQP4 to the perivascular astrocyte endfoot membrane depends on the dystrophin complex, the localization of the 71-kDa brain-specific isoform of dystrophin was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In non-MTLE hippocampus, dystrophin was preferentially localized near blood vessels. However, in the MTLE hippocampus, the perivascular dystrophin was absent in sclerotic areas, suggesting that the loss of perivascular AQP4 is secondary to a disruption of the dystrophin complex. We postulate that the loss of perivascular AQP4 in MTLE is likely to result in a perturbed flux of water through astrocytes leading to an impaired buffering of extracellular K+ and an increased propensity for seizures.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method, laminar population analysis (LPA), for analysis of laminar-electrode (linear multielectrode) data, where physiological constraints are explicitly incorporated in the mathematical model: the high-frequency band [multiunit activity (MUA)] is modeled as a sum over contributions from firing activity of multiple cortical populations, whereas the low-frequency band [local field potential (LFP)] is assumed to reflect the dendritic currents caused by synaptic inputs evoked by this firing. The method is applied to stimulus-averaged laminar-electrode data from barrel cortex of anesthetized rat after single whisker flicks. Two sample data sets, distinguished by stimulus paradigm, type of applied anesthesia, and electrical boundary conditions, are studied in detail. These data sets are well accounted for by a model with four cortical populations: one supragranular, one granular, and two infragranular populations. Population current source densities (CSDs; the CSD signatures after firing in a particular population) provided by LPA are further used to estimate the synaptic connection pattern between the various populations using a new LFP template-fitting technique, where LFP population templates are found by the electrostatic forward solution based on results from compartmental modeling of morphologically reconstructed neurons. Our analysis confirms previous experimental findings regarding the synaptic connections from neurons in the granular layer onto neurons in the supragranular layers and provides predictions about other synaptic connections. Furthermore, the time dependence of the stimulus-evoked population firing activity is predicted, and the temporal ordering of response onset is found to be compatible with earlier findings.},

  Abstract                 = {Stroke poses a massive burden of disease, yet we have few effective therapies. The paucity of therapeutic options stands contrary to intensive research efforts. The failure of these past investments demands a thorough re-examination of the pathophysiology of ischaemic brain injury. Several critical areas hold the key to overcoming the translational roadblock: (1) vascular occlusion: current recanalization strategies have limited effectiveness and may have serious side effects; (2) complexity of stroke pathobiology: therapy must acknowledge the 'Janus-faced' nature of many stroke targets and must identify endogenous neuroprotective and repair mechanisms; (3) inflammation and brain-immune-system interaction: inflammation contributes to lesion expansion, but is also instrumental in lesion containment and repair; stroke outcome is modulated by the interaction of the injured brain with the immune system; (4) regeneration: the potential of the brain for reorganization, plasticity and repair after injury is much greater than previously thought; (5) confounding factors, long-term outcome and predictive modelling. These 5 areas are linked on all levels and therefore need to be tackled by an integrative approach and innovative therapeutic strategies.},

We demonstrate that the work done by the pumps equals the change in potential energy of the cell, plus the energy lost in downhill ionic fluxes through the channels and exchangers. The theory is illustrated in a simple model of spontaneously active cells in the cardiac pacemaker. The model predicts the experimentally observed intracellular ionic concentration of potassium, calcium and sodium. Likewise, the shapes of the simulated action potential and five membrane currents are in good agreement with experiment. We do not see any drift in the values of the concentrations in a long time simulation, and we obtain the same asymptotic values when starting from the full equilibrium situation with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {Cortical spreading depression is a slowly propagating wave of near-complete depolarization of brain cells followed by temporary suppression of neuronal activity. Accumulating evidence indicates that cortical spreading depression underlies the migraine aura and that similar waves promote tissue damage in stroke, trauma, and hemorrhage. Cortical spreading depression is characterized by neuronal swelling, profound elevation of extracellular potassium and glutamate, multiphasic blood flow changes, and drop in tissue oxygen tension. The slow speed of the cortical spreading depression wave implies that it is mediated by diffusion of a chemical substance, yet the identity of this substance and the pathway it follows are unknown. Intercellular spread between gap junction-coupled neurons or glial cells and interstitial diffusion of K(+) or glutamate have been proposed. Here we use extracellular direct current potential recordings, K(+)-sensitive microelectrodes, and 2-photon imaging with ultrasensitive Ca(2+) and glutamate fluorescent probes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of ionic shifts associated with the propagation of cortical spreading depression in the visual cortex of adult living mice. Our data argue against intercellular spread of Ca(2+) carrying the cortical spreading depression wavefront and are in favor of interstitial K(+) diffusion, rather than glutamate diffusion, as the leading event in cortical spreading depression.},

  Abstract                 = {Primary brain tumors (gliomas) often present with peritumoral edema. Their ability to thrive in this osmotically altered environment prompted us to examine volume regulation in human glioma cells, specifically the relative contribution of Cl(-) channels and transporters to this process. After a hyposmotic challenge, cultured astrocytes, D54-MG glioma cells, and glioma cells from human patient biopsies exhibited a regulatory volume decrease (RVD). Although astrocytes were not able to completely reestablish their original prechallenge volumes, glioma cells exhibited complete volume recovery, sometimes recovering to a volume smaller than their original volumes (V(Post-RVD) < V(baseline)). In glioma cells, RVD was largely inhibited by treatment with a combination of Cl(-) channel inhibitors, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) and Cd(2+) (V(Post-RVD) > 1.4*V(baseline)). Volume regulation was also attenuated to a lesser degree by the addition of R-(+)-[(2-n-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]acetic acid (DIOA), a known K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (KCC) inhibitor. To dissect the relative contribution of channels vs. transporters in RVD, we took advantage of the comparatively high temperature dependence of transport processes vs. channel-mediated diffusion. Cooling D54-MG glioma cells to 15 degrees C resulted in a loss of DIOA-sensitive volume regulation. Moreover, at 15 degrees C, the channel blockers NPPB + Cd(2+) completely inhibited RVD and cells behaved like perfect osmometers. The calculated osmolyte flux during RVD under these experimental conditions suggests that the relative contribution of Cl(-) channels vs. transporters to this process is approximately 60-70\% and approximately 30-40\%, respectively. Finally, we identified several candidate proteins that may be involved in RVD, including the Cl(-) channels ClC-2, ClC-3, ClC-5, ClC-6, and ClC-7 and the transporters KCC1 and KCC3a.},

So far, theory-based metabolic optimization techniques have mostly been applied to steady-state conditions or the minimization of transition time, using either linear stoichiometric models or fully kinetic models within biochemical systems theory (BST). This article addresses the related problem of controllability, where the task is to steer a non-linear biochemical system, within a given time period, from an initial state to some target state, which may or may not be a steady state. For this purpose, BST models in S-system form are transformed into affine non-linear control systems, which are subjected to an exact feedback linearization that permits controllability through independent variables. The method is exemplified with a small glycolytic-glycogenolytic pathway that had been analyzed previously by several other authors in different contexts.},

We highlight the implications and the challenges introduced by these results from a conceptual and computational perspective. We further provide modeling directions on how these data might extend our knowledge of astrocytic properties and sleep function. Given our evolving understanding of how local cellular activities during sleep lead to functional outcomes for the brain, further mechanistic and theoretical understanding of astrocytic contribution to these dynamics will undoubtedly be of great basic and translational benefit.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine why some pathways but not others produce sizable local field potentials (LFPs) and how far from the source can these be recorded, complementary experimental analyses and realistic modeling of specific brain structures are required. In the present study, we combined multiple in vivo linear recordings in rats and a tridimensional finite element model of the dentate gyrus, a curved structure displaying abnormally large positive LFPs. We demonstrate that the polarized dendritic arbour of granule cells (GCs), combined with the curved layered configuration of the population promote the spatial clustering of GC currents in the interposed hilus and project them through the open side at a distance from cell domains. LFPs grow up to 20 times larger than observed in synaptic sites. The dominant positive polarity of hilar LFPs was only produced by the synchronous activation of GCs in both blades by either somatic inhibition or dendritic excitation. Moreover, the corresponding anatomical pathways must project to both blades of the dentate gyrus as even a mild decrease in the spatial synchronization resulted in a dramatic reduction in LFP power in distant sites, yet not in the GC domains. It is concluded that the activation of layered structures may establish sharply delimited spatial domains where synaptic currents from one or another input appear to be segregated according to the topology of afferent pathways and the cytoarchitectonic features of the target population. These also determine preferred directions for volume conduction in the brain, of relevance for interpretation of surface EEG recordings.},

Using intra- and extra-cellular solutions with symmetrical high Cl- content and with the monovalent cations replaced with N-methyl-D-glucamine, time- and voltage-dependent Cl- currents were elicited in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of 0 mV. The inward currents activated slowly and did not display any time-dependent inactivation. The rising phase of the current traces was best fitted with two exponential components whose time constants decreased with larger hyperpolarization. The steady-state activation of IClh was well described by a single Boltzmann function with a half-maximal activation potential at - 62 mV and a slope of 19 mV that yields to an apparent gating charge of 1.3. The anion selectivity sequence was Cl- = Br- = I- > F- > cyclamate > or = gluconate. External application of the putative Cl- channel blockers 4,4 diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2 disulphonic acid or 4-acetamido-4-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulphonic acid did not affect IClh. By contrast, anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, as well as Cd2+ and Zn2+, inhibited, albeit with different potencies, the Cl- current. Taken together, these results indicate that dBcAMP-treated cultured rat cortical astrocytes express a Cl- inward rectifier, which exhibits similar but not identical features compared with those of the cloned and heterologously expressed hyperpolarization-activated Cl- channel ClC-2.},

  Abstract                 = {Spontaneous neurotransmitter release and activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) each play a role in the plasticity of neuronal synapses. Astrocytes may contribute to short- and long-term synaptic changes by signaling to neurons via these processes. Spontaneous whole-cell AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents were recorded in CA1 pyramidal cells in situ while evoking Ca2+ increases in the adjacent stratum radiatum astrocytes by uncaging IP3. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to deliver caged IP3 and the Ca2+ indicator dye Oregon green BAPTA-1 to astrocytes. Neurons were patch-clamped and filled with Alexa 568 hydrazide dye to visualize their morphological relationship to the astrocyte. On uncaging of IP3, astrocyte Ca2+ responses reliably propagated as a wave into the very fine distal processes, synchronizing Ca2+ activity within astrocyte microdomains. The intracellular astrocyte Ca2+ wave coincided with a significant increase in the frequency of AMPA spontaneous EPSCs, but with no change in their kinetics. AMPAR current amplitudes were increased as well, but not significantly (p = 0.06). The increased frequency of AMPAR currents was sensitive to the group I mGluR antagonists LY367385 and 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine, suggesting that (1) astrocytes released glutamate in response to IP3 uncaging, and (2) glutamate released by astrocytes activated group I mGluRs to facilitate the release of glutamate from excitatory neuronal presynaptic boutons. These results extend previous studies, which have shown astrocyte modulation of neuronal activity in vitro and suggest that astrocyte-to-neuron signaling in intact tissue may contribute to synaptic plasticity.},

The signals between neurons and glia include ion fluxes, neurotransmitters, cell adhesion molecules, and specialized signaling molecules released from synaptic and nonsynaptic regions of the neuron. In contrast to the serial flow of information along chains of neurons, glia communicate with other glial cells through intracellular waves of calcium and via intercellular diffusion of chemical messengers. By releasing neurotransmitters and other extracellular signaling molecules, glia can affect neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission and perhaps coordinate activity across networks of neurons.},

Action potential curves plotted against distance show discontinuities in slope, proportional to the nodal action currents, at the nodes. Action potential curves plotted against time, at the nodes and in the internodes, show a marked difference in steepness of the rising phase, but little difference in peak height.

  Abstract                 = {The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter plays important roles in cell ion homeostasis and volume control and is particularly important in mediating the movement of ions and thus water across epithelia. In addition to being affected by the concentration of the transported ions, cotransport is affected by cell volume, hormones, growth factors, oxygen tension, and intracellular ionized Mg(2+) concentration. These probably influence transport through three main routes acting in parallel: cotransporter phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions and cell Cl(-) concentration. Many effects are mediated, at least in part, by changes in protein phosphorylation, and are disrupted by kinase and phosphatase inhibitors, and manoeuvres that reduce cell ATP content. In some cases, phosphorylation of the cotransporter itself on serine and threonine (but not tyrosine) is associated with changes in transport rate, in others, phosphorylation of associated proteins has more influence. Analysis of the stimulation of cotransport by calyculin A, arsenite and deoxygenation suggests that the cotransporter is phosphorylated by several kinases and dephosphorylated by several phosphatases. These kinases and phosphatases may themselves be regulated by phosphorylation of residues including tyrosine, with Src kinases possibly playing an important role. Protein-protein interactions also influence cotransport activity. Cotransporter molecules bind to each other to form high molecular weight complexes, they also bind to other members of the cation-chloride cotransport family, to a variety of cytoskeletal proteins, and to enzymes that are part of regulatory cascades. Many of these interactions affect transport and may override the effects of cotransporter phosphorylation. Cell Cl(-) may also directly affect the way the cotransporter functions independently of its role as substrate.},

It has been asserted that this is because there is a high density of Na(+) channels in the AIS. However, we found that action potential-associated Na(+) flux, as measured by high-speed fluorescence Na(+) imaging, was about threefold larger in the rat AIS than in the soma. Spike-evoked Na(+) flux in the AIS and the first node of Ranvier was similar and was eightfold lower in basal dendrites. At near-threshold voltages, persistent Na(+) conductance was almost entirely axonal. On a time scale of seconds, passive diffusion, and not pumping, was responsible for maintaining transmembrane Na(+) gradients in thin axons during high-frequency action potential firing. In computer simulations, these data were consistent with the known features of action potential generation in these neurons.},

(2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37542-37550), we identify three phosphothreonines important in this process. Using a phospho-specific antibody (anti-phospho-NKCC1 antibody R5) raised against a diphosphopeptide containing Thr(212) and Thr(217) of human NKCC, we were readily able to monitor the cotransporter activation state. In (32)P phosphorylation experiments with rectal gland tubules, we show that the R5 antibody signal is proportional to the amount of (32)P incorporated into NKCC1; and in experiments with NKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cells, we demonstrate that R5-detected phosphorylation directly mirrors functional activation. Immunofluorescence analysis of shark rectal gland shows activation-dependent R5 antibody staining along the basolateral membrane. In perfused rat parotid glands, isoproterenol induced staining of both acinar and ductal cells along the basolateral membrane. Isoproterenol also induced basolateral staining of the epithelial cells in rat trachea, whereas basal cells in the subepithelial tissue displayed heavy, non-polarized staining of the cell membrane. In rat colon, agonist stimulation induced staining along the basolateral membrane of crypt cells. These data provide direct evidence of NKCC1 regulation in these tissues, and they further link phosphorylation of NKCC1 with its activation in transfected cells and native tissue. The high conservation of the regulatory threonine residues among NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC family members, together with the fact that tissues from divergent vertebrate species exhibit similar R5-binding profiles, lends further support to the role of this regulatory locus in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental evidences point out the participation of nonsynaptic mechanisms (e.g., fluctuations in extracellular ions) in epileptiform bursting and spreading depression (SD). During these abnormal oscillatory patterns, it is observed an increase of extracellular potassium concentration [K(+)](o) and a decrease of extracellular calcium concentration [Ca(2+)](o) which raises the neuronal excitability. However, whether the high [K(+)](o) triggers and propagates these abnormal neuronal activities or plays a secondary role into this process is unclear. To better understand the influence of extracellular potassium dynamics in these oscillatory patterns, the experimental conditions of high [K(+)](o) and zero [Ca(2+)](o) were replicated in an extended Golomb model where we added important regulatory mechanisms of ion concentration as Na(+)-K(+) pump, ion diffusion and glial buffering. Within these conditions, simulations of the cell model exhibit seizure-like discharges (ictal bursting). The SD was elicited by the interruption of the Na(+)-K(+) pump activity, mimicking the effect of cellular hypoxia (an experimental protocol to elicit SD, the hypoxia-induced SD). We used the bifurcation theory and the fast-slow method to analyze the interference of K(+) dynamics in the cellular excitability. This analysis indicates that the system loses its stability at a high [K(+)](o), transiting to an elevated state of neuronal excitability. Effects of high [K(+)](o) are observed in different stages of ictal bursting and SD. In the initial stage, the increase of [K(+)](o) creates favorable conditions to trigger both oscillatory patterns. During the neuronal activity, a continuous growth of [K(+)](o) by outward K(+) flow depresses K(+) currents in a positive feedback way. At the last stage, due to the depression of K(+) currents, the Na(+)-K(+) pump is the main mechanism in the end of neuronal activity. Thus, this work suggests that [K(+)](o) dynamics may play a fundamental role in these abnormal oscillatory patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Although alternans of action potential duration (APD) is a robust feature of the rapidly paced canine ventricle, currently available ionic models of cardiac myocytes do not recreate this phenomenon. To address this problem, we developed a new ionic model using formulations of currents based on previous models and recent experimental data. Compared with existing models, the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was decreased at depolarized potentials, the maximum conductance and rectification of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)) were increased, and I(Kr) activation kinetics were slowed. The slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) was increased in magnitude and activation shifted to less positive voltages, and the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) was modified to produce a smaller, more rapidly inactivating current. Finally, a simplified form of intracellular calcium dynamics was adopted. In this model, APD alternans occurred at cycle lengths = 150-210 ms, with a maximum alternans amplitude of 39 ms. APD alternans was suppressed by decreasing I(Ca) magnitude or calcium-induced inactivation and by increasing the magnitude of I(K1), I(Kr), or I(Ks). These results establish an ionic basis for APD alternans, which should facilitate the development of pharmacological approaches to eliminating alternans.},

  Abstract                 = {Little is known about the dynamics and mechanisms of transitions between tonic firing and bursting in cortical networks. Here, we use a computational model of a neocortical circuit with extracellular potassium dynamics to show that activity-dependent modulation of intrinsic excitability can lead to sustained oscillations with slow transitions between two distinct firing modes: fast run (tonic spiking or fast bursts with few spikes) and slow bursting. These transitions are caused by a bistability with hysteresis in a pyramidal cell model. Balanced excitation and inhibition stabilizes a network of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in the bistable region and causes sustained periodic alternations between distinct oscillatory states. During spike-wave seizures, neocortical paroxysmal activity exhibits qualitatively similar slow transitions between fast run and bursting. We therefore predict that extracellular potassium dynamics can cause alternating episodes of fast and slow oscillatory states in both normal and epileptic neocortical networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Local field potentials and the underlying endogenous electric fields (EFs) are traditionally considered to be epiphenomena of structured neuronal network activity. Recently, however, externally applied EFs have been shown to modulate pharmacologically evoked network activity in rodent hippocampus. In contrast, very little is known about the role of endogenous EFs during physiological activity states in neocortex. Here, we used the neocortical slow oscillation in vitro as a model system to show that weak sinusoidal and naturalistic EFs enhance and entrain physiological neocortical network activity with an amplitude threshold within the range of in vivo endogenous field strengths. Modulation of network activity by positive and negative feedback fields based on the network activity in real-time provide direct evidence for a feedback loop between neuronal activity and endogenous EF. This significant susceptibility of active networks to EFs that only cause small changes in membrane potential in individual neurons suggests that endogenous EFs could guide neocortical network activity.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper quantifies recent experimental results through a general physical description of the mechanisms that might control two fundamental cellular parameters, resting potential (Em) and cell volume (Vc), thereby clarifying the complex relationships between them. Em was determined directly from a charge difference (CD) equation involving total intracellular ionic charge and membrane capacitance (Cm). This avoided the equilibrium condition dEm/dt = 0 required in determinations of Em by previous work based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and its derivatives and thus permitted precise calculation of Em even under non-equilibrium conditions. It could accurately model the influence upon Em of changes in Cm or Vc and of membrane transport processes such as the Na+-K+-ATPase and ion cotransport. Given a stable and adequate membrane Na+-K+-ATPase density (N), Vc and Em both converged to unique steady-state values even from sharply divergent initial intracellular ionic concentrations. For any constant set of transmembrane ion permeabilities, this set point of Vc was then determined by the intracellular membrane-impermeant solute content (X-i) and its mean charge valency (zX), while in contrast, the set point of Em was determined solely by zX. Independent changes in membrane Na+ (PNa) or K+ permeabilities (PK) or activation of cation-chloride cotransporters could perturb Vc and Em but subsequent reversal of such changes permitted full recovery of both Vc and Em to the original set points. Proportionate changes in PNa, PK and N, or changes in Cl- permeability (PCl) instead conserved steady-state Vc and Em but altered their rates of relaxation following any discrete perturbation. PCl additionally determined the relative effect of cotransporter activity on Vc and Em, in agreement with recent experimental results. In contrast, changes in Xi- produced by introduction of a finite permeability term to X- (PX) that did not alter zX caused sustained changes in Vc that were independent of Em and that persisted when PX returned to zero. Where such fluxes also altered the effective zX they additionally altered the steady state Em. This offers a basis for the suggested roles of amino acid fluxes in long-term volume regulatory processes in a variety of excitable tissues.},

  Abstract                 = {The aquaporin-4 (AQP4) pool in the perivascular astrocyte membranes has been shown to be critically involved in the formation and dissolution of brain edema. Cerebral edema is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in stroke. It is therefore essential to know whether the perivascular pool of AQP4 is up- or down-regulated after an ischemic insult, because such changes would determine the time course of edema formation. Here we demonstrate by quantitative immunogold cytochemistry that the ischemic striatum and neocortex show distinct patterns of AQP4 expression in the reperfusion phase after 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The striatal core displays a loss of perivascular AQP4 at 24 hr of reperfusion with no sign of subsequent recovery. The most affected part of the cortex also exhibits loss of perivascular AQP4. This loss is of magnitude similar to that of the striatal core, but it shows a partial recovery toward 72 hr of reperfusion. By freeze fracture we show that the loss of perivascular AQP4 is associated with the disappearance of the square lattices of particles that normally are distinct features of the perivascular astrocyte membrane. The cortical border zone differs from the central part of the ischemic lesion by showing no loss of perivascular AQP4 at 24 hr of reperfusion but rather a slight increase. These data indicate that the size of the AQP4 pool that controls the exchange of fluid between brain and blood during edema formation and dissolution is subject to large and region-specific changes in the reperfusion phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Chloride/bicarbonate anion exchangers (AEs), found in the plasma membrane of most mammalian cells, are involved in pH regulation and bicarbonate metabolism. Although AE2 and AE3 are highly similar in sequence, AE2-transport activity was 10-fold higher than AE3 (41 versus 4 mM x min(-1) respectively), when expressed by transient transfection of HEK-293 cells. AE2-AE3 chimaeras were constructed to define the region responsible for differences in transport activity. The level of AE2 expression was approx. 30\% higher than that of AE3. Processing to the cell surface, studied by chemical labelling and confocal microscopy, showed that AE2 is processed to the cell surface approx. 8-fold more efficiently than AE3. The efficiency of cell-surface processing was dependent on the cytoplasmic domain, since the AE2 domain conferred efficient processing upon the AE3 membrane domain, with a predominant role for amino acids 322-677 of AE2. AE2 that was expressed in HEK-293 cells was glycosylated, but little of AE3 was. However, AE2 expressed in the presence of the glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, was not glycosylated, yet retained 85 +/- 8\% of anion-transport activity. Therefore glycosylation has little, if any, role in the cell-surface processing or activity of AE2 or AE3. We conclude that the low anion-transport activity of AE3 in HEK-293 cells is due to low level processing to the plasma membrane, possibly owing to protein interactions with the AE3 cytoplasmic domain.},

  Abstract                 = {The Na+ --Cl- --K+ isoform 1 (NKCC1) is a co-transporter that increases the intracellular concentration of chloride. NKCC1 plays a critical role in neuronal excitability and it has been recently suggested that it can contribute to hyperalgesic states by modulating the chloride concentration inside nociceptive neurons. In the spinal cord, trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors from the cytosol to the plasma membrane has been demonstrated to contribute to the development of hyperalgesia. However, it is unknown if trafficking of co-transporters can also occur in the nervous system or if it can be induced by painful stimulation. In this study, we have induced referred mechanical hyperalgesia in vivo by intracolonic instillation of capsaicin in mice. Using subcellular fractionation of proteins and cross-linking of membrane proteins we have observed that intracolonic capsaicin induced a 50\% increase in NKCC1 in the plasma membrane of lumbosacral spinal cord 90 and 180 min after instillation, in parallel with a similar decrease in the cytosolic fraction. These effects returned to basal levels 6 h after capsaicin treatment. Intracolonic capsaicin also evoked a rapid (10 min) and transient phosphorylation of NKCC1, however, intracolonic saline did not produce significant changes in either NKCC1 trafficking or phosphorylation and none of the treatments induced any alterations of NKCC1 in the thoracic spinal cord. These results suggest that phosphorylation and recruitment of NKCC1 might play a role in referred mechanical hyperalgesia evoked by a painful visceral stimulus. The time course of the effects observed suggests that phosphorylation could contribute to the initial generation of hyperalgesia whereas trafficking could participate in the maintenance of hyperalgesic states observed at longer time points.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental evidence suggests the existence of a negative feedback pathway between horizontal cells and cone photoreceptors in the outer plexiform layer of the retina that modulates the flow of calcium ions into the synaptic terminals of cones. However, the underlying mechanism for this feedback is controversial and there are currently three competing hypotheses: the ephaptic hypothesis, the pH hypothesis, and the GABA hypothesis. The goal of this investigation is to demonstrate the ephaptic hypothesis by means of detailed numerical simulations. The drift-diffusion (Poisson-Nernst-Planck) model with membrane boundary current equations is applied to a realistic two-dimensional cross-section of the triad synapse in the goldfish retina to verify the existence of strictly electrical feedback, as predicted by the ephaptic hypothesis. The effect on electrical feedback from the behavior of the bipolar cell membrane potential is also explored. The computed steady-state cone calcium transmembrane current-voltage curves for several cases are presented and compared with experimental data on goldfish. The results provide convincing evidence that an ephaptic mechanism can produce the feedback effect seen in experiments.

In particular, this is the case for astrocytes that form functional networks of communicating cells. Altogether these findings lead to reconsider the interaction between neurons and glia that should not be solely studied at the single cell level but also at a more integrated level as the interplay between neuronal circuits and glial networks.},

  Abstract                 = {The electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) is expressed in glial cells in the brain and plays an important role in the regulation of both intracellular and extracellular pH. Differential vulnerability to acidosis between neurons and glia has been noted and may contribute to infarction after cerebral ischemia. Ionic substitution studies and inhibition of injury by 4, 4'-di-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid suggest that NBC is involved in astrocyte vulnerability to acidic injury. Recently two NBC cDNAs differing in 5'-untranslated and N-terminal coding sequence have been cloned from kidney and pancreas. We cloned one of these cDNAs from rat brain and demonstrate here that the clone is functional by expression in Xenopus oocytes. We determined the developmental and regional expression of NBC in the brain by in situ hybridization. Expression was observed in the spinal cord at embryonic day 17, whereas expression in brain was first seen at approximately postnatal day 0 (P0), increased at P15, and persisted in the adult brain. Expression was widespread throughout the cerebellum, cortex, olfactory bulb, and subcortical structures. Cellular resolution of the in situ hybridization signal and double labeling for glial fibrillary acidic protein were consistent with a glial localization for NBC. Expression of NBC in 3T3 cells that do not normally express this transporter rendered them vulnerable to acid injury. The expression profile suggests that this transporter is critical during the later stages of brain development and could be one of the factors contributing to the different patterns of injury seen in perinatal versus adult cerebral ischemia.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnocellular neuroendocrine cells of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) release vasopressin (VP) systemically and locally during osmotic challenge. Although both central VP and nitric oxide (NO) release appear to reduce osmotically stimulated systemic VP release, it is unknown whether they interact locally in the SON to enhance somatodendritic release of VP, a phenomenon believed to regulate systemic VP release. In this study, we examined the contribution of VP receptor subtypes and NO to local VP release from the rat SON elicited by systemic injection of 3.5 m saline. Treatment of SON punches with VP receptor antagonists decreased osmotically stimulated intranuclear VP release. Similarly, blockade of NO production, or addition of NO scavengers, reduced stimulated VP, glutamate, and aspartate release, suggesting that local NO production and activity are critical for osmotically induced intranuclear VP and excitatory amino acid release. An increase in endogenous NO release from SON punches in response to hyperosmolality was confirmed by enzymatic NO assay. Consistent with enhanced glutamate and VP release from stimulated rat SON punches, the ionotropic glutamate receptor blocker kynurenate decreased stimulated local VP release without affecting NO release. These data suggest that NO enhances local VP release in part by facilitating local release of glutamate/aspartate and that glutamate receptor activity is required for the stimulation of local VP release by osmotic challenge. Collectively, these results suggest that local VP receptors, NO, and glutamatergic signaling mediate the amplification of intranuclear VP release during hyperosmolality and may contribute to efficient, but not exhaustive, systemic release of VP during osmoregulatory challenge.},

RECENT FINDINGS: A major breakthrough has been the description of a macromolecular complex responsible for the regulatory phosphorylation of NKCCs, involving members of two families of novel serine-threonine kinases: WNK kinases and Ste-20-related kinases SPAK and OSR1. A new regulatory pathway has been defined, with WNK lying upstream of SPAK-OSR1 and the latter kinases directly phosphorylating NKCC. New evidence has arisen supporting regulation of NKCC membrane expression, possibly through the same mechanisms regulating phosphorylation. Alternative splicing of kidney-specific NKCC2 also appears to be a regulated process. Renal roles for NKCC1 have been described, including an unexpected role in controlling renin secretion.

SUMMARY: We now begin to understand the biochemical pathways mediating NKCC regulatory phosphorylation, which are governed by kinases that, like NKCCs, have been linked to the genesis of hypertension. Complementary long-term regulation of NKCC membrane expression, alternative splicing or gene transcription, however, should not be overlooked. Deciphering the relationships between these processes will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension.},

  Abstract                 = {The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of Na(+) was determined in live rat brain. The brain extracellular-to-intracellular Na(+) content ratio is approximately 8:2, which is the inverse of that for water in these spaces. Consequently, the ADC of Na(+) is primarily affected by motion in the extracellular space, and Na(+) can be viewed as a reporter molecule for motion in that space. Likewise, water ADC is dominated by intracellular motion. The brain Na(+) ADC was 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm(2)/ms, which is 61\% of the aqueous Na(+) free diffusion coefficient (D(free)) at 37 degrees C (1.9 microm(2)/ms), while the ADC for brain water is 28\% of the water D(free) at 37 degrees C (3 microm(2)/ms). This suggests that the ADC of molecular species within the extracellular space is roughly twofold that within the intracellular space. In postmortem brain, both Na(+) and water decrease to 17\% of the respective D(free) values. These results are consistent with Na(+) and water ADC values sharing the same biophysical determinants in postmortem brain. The observed difference between Na(+) and water ADC/D(free) ratios in living brain tissue may be attributable to the extracellular environment hindering molecular displacements twofold less than the intracellular environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Many diverse retinal disorders are characterized by retinal edema; yet, little experimental attention has been given to understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying and contributing to these fluid-based disorders. Water transport in and out of cells is achieved by specialized membrane channels, with most rapid water transport regulated by transmembrane water channels known as aquaporins (AQPs). The predominant AQP in the mammalian retina is AQP4, which is expressed on the M\"{u}ller glial cells. M\"{u}ller cells have previously been shown to modulate neuronal activity by modifying the concentrations of ions, neurotransmitters, and other neuroactive substances within the extracellular space between the inner and the outer limiting membrane. In doing so, M\"{u}ller cells maintain extracellular homeostasis, especially with regard to the spatial buffering of extracellular potassium (K+) via inward rectifying K+ channels (Kir channels). Recent studies of water transport and the spatial buffering of K+ through glial cells have highlighted the involvement of both AQP4 and Kir channels in regulating the extracellular environment in the brain and retina. As both glial functions are associated with neuronal activation, controversy exists in the literature as to whether the relationship is functionally dependent. It is argued in this review that as AQP4 channels are likely to be the conduit for facilitating fluid homeostasis in the inner retina during light activation, AQP4 channels are also likely to play a consequent role in the regulation of ocular volume and growth. Recent research has already shown that the level of AQP4 expression is associated with environmentally driven manipulations of light activity on the retina and the development of myopia.},

Treadmill training (20 m/min, 20\% grade, 30 min/day, 5 days/wk) stimulated total (86)Rb influx and increased NKCC activity in the soleus muscle after 2 wk and in the plantaris muscle after 4 wk. Exercise-induced NKCC activity was associated with a 1.4- to 2-fold increase in ERK phosphorylation. Isoproterenol, which activates ERK and NKCC in sedentary muscle, caused a remarkable inhibition of the exercise-induced NKCC activity. Furthermore, isoproterenol inhibition of exercise-induced NKCC activity was accompanied with decreased ERK phosphorylation in the plantaris muscle. Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation on both Thr(308) and Ser(473), which activates Akt and inhibits NKCC activity in sedentary muscle, was stimulated by acute and chronic exercise. This Akt activation was unaffected by isoproterenol.

To study the precise mechanisms regulating NKCC activity, rat soleus and plantaris muscles were stimulated ex vivo by insulin or isoproterenol (ISO). Both hormones stimulated total uptake of the potassium congener (86)Rb by 25--70\%. However, only ISO stimulated the NKCC-mediated (86)Rb uptake. Insulin inhibited the ISO-stimulated NKCC activity, and this counteraction was sensitive to the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 in the predominantly slow-twitch soleus muscle. Pretreatment of the soleus muscle with the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 or with SB203580 uncovered an insulin-stimulated NKCC activity and also increased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK. In the predominantly fast-twitch plantaris muscle, insulin-stimulated NKCC activity became apparent only after inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity, accompanied by an increase in ERK phosphorylation. PI 3-kinase inhibitors also abolished insulin-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the plantaris muscle and Akt phosphorylation in both muscles. These data demonstrated that insulin inhibits NKCC-mediated transport in skeletal muscle through PI 3-kinase-sensitive and SB203580-sensitive mechanisms. Furthermore, differential activation of signaling cascade elements after hormonal stimulation may contribute to fiber-type specificity in the control of potassium transport by skeletal muscle.},

  Abstract                 = {Dystroglycan (DG) is part of a multiprotein complex that links the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton of muscle fibers and that is involved in aggregating acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This complex is also expressed in regions of the central nervous system where it is localized to both neuronal and glial cells. DG and the inwardly rectifying potassium channels, Kir4.1, are concentrated at the interface of astroglia and small blood vessels. These channels are involved in siphoning potassium released into the extracellular space after neuronal excitation. This raises the possibility that DG may be involved in targeting Kir4.1 channels to specific domains of astroglia. To address this question, we used mixed hippocampal cultures to investigate the distribution of DG, syntrophin, dystrobrevin, and Kir4.1 channels, as well as aquaporin-permeable water channels, AQP4. These proteins exhibit a similar distribution pattern and form aggregates in astrocytes cultured on laminin. Both DG and syntrophin colocalize with Kir4.1 channel aggregates in astrocytes. Similarly, DG colocalizes with AQP4 channel aggregates. Quantitative studies show a significant increase of Kir4.1 and AQP4 channel aggregates in astrocytes cultured in the presence of laminin when compared with those in the absence of laminin. These findings show that laminin has a role in Kir4.1 and AQP4 channel aggregation and suggest that this may be mediated via a dystroglycan-containing complex. This study reveals a novel functional role for DG in brain including K+ buffering and water homeostasis.},

KCC2 was highly expressed in parvalbumin-containing interneurons, as well as in subsets of calbindin, calretinin and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a-immunoreactive interneurons. During the first 2 postnatal weeks, an increase of KCC2 staining was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, correlating temporally with the arrival of entorhinal cortical inputs. Subcellular localization demonstrated KCC2 in the plasma membranes. Immunoreactivity in principal cells was responsible for the diffuse staining found in the neuropil. In these cells, KCC2 was detected primarily in dendritic spine heads, at the origin of spines and, at a much lower level on the somata and dendritic shafts. KCC2 expression was considerably higher in the somata and dendrites of interneurons, most notably of parvalbumin-containing cells, as well as in the thorny excrescences of CA3 pyramidal cells and in the spines of spiny hilar and stratum lucidum interneurons. The data indicate that KCC2 is highly expressed in the vicinity of excitatory inputs in the hippocampus, perhaps in close association with extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. A high level of excitation is known to lead to a simultaneous net influx of Na+ and Cl-, as evidenced by dendritic swelling. KCC2 located in the same microenvironment may provide a Cl- extrusion mechanism to deal with both ion and water homeostasis in addition to its role in setting the driving force of Cl- currents involved in fast postsynaptic inhibition.},

  Abstract                 = {The water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is abundantly expressed in astrocytes. There is now compelling evidence that AQP4 may contribute to an unfavorable course in brain edema. Acute lead intoxication is a condition that causes brain damage preceded by brain edema. Here we report that lead increases AQP4 water permeability (P(f)) in astrocytes. A rat astrocyte cell line that does not express aquaporin 4 was transiently transfected with aquaporin 4 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Using confocal laser scanning microscopy we measured water permeability in these cells and in AQP4-negative cells located on the same plate. AQP4-expressing astrocytes had a three-fold higher water permeability than astrocytes not expressing AQP4. Lead exposure induced a significant, 40\%, increase in water permeability in astrocytes expressing AQP4, but had no effect on P(f) in astrocytes not expressing AQP4. The increase in water permeability persisted after lead washout, while treatment with a lead chelator, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, abolished the lead-induced increase in P(f). The effect of lead was attenuated in the presence of a calcium (Ca(2+))/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor, but not in the presence of a protein kinase C inhibitor. In cells expressing AQP4 where the consensus site for CaMKII phosphorylation was mutated, lead failed to increase water permeability. Lead exposure also increased P(f) in rat astroglial cells in primary culture, which express endogenous AQP4. Lead had no effect on P(f) in astrocytes transfected with aquaporin 3. In situ hybridization studies on rat brain after oral lead intake for three days showed no change in distribution of AQP4 mRNA. It is suggested that lead-triggered stimulation of water transport in AQP4-expressing astrocytes may contribute to the pathology of acute lead intoxication.},

  Abstract                 = {Anticonvulsant properties of furosemide have been suggested to reduce neuronal synchronization via its inhibitory effect on the Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transport system. We have studied effects of furosemide on spontaneous epileptiform activity and analysed effects of furosemide on amplitudes of stimulus-induced population-spikes, on stimulus-induced K+ changes, on extracellular pH changes at rest and during stimulation, and on changes in the extracellular space-volume. We used three different in vitro models of epilepsy in the combined hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slice preparation. Furosemide reversibly suppressed low Ca2+-induced epileptiform activity in hippocampus proper and blocked or significantly reduced different types of epileptiform discharges in the low Mg2+ model and the 4-aminopyridine model. Amplitudes of evoked field potentials underwent an initial slight increase followed by a significant reduction after prolonged treatment with furosemide. Stimulus-induced increases in extracellular potassium were also significantly reduced. Furosemide caused an alkaline shift at rest. Stimulus-induced pH transients changed from a biphasic alkalotic-acidotic sequence to a monophasic alkalotic shift. Stimulation-induced shrinkage of extracellular space-volume was reduced by furosemide, whereas no effect on baseline extracellular space-volume was seen. We conclude, that furosemide possesses strong anticonvulsive effects in various in vitro models of epilepsy. The anticonvulsive properties of furosemide cannot be explained by its effects on extracellular pH changes but appear in part to be mediated via a reduced excitability with consequent reduction of activity-induced potassium rises. Finally, partial inhibition of activity-induced extracellular space shrinkage may contribute to its anticonvulsant properties.},

  Abstract                 = {When neurons fire action potentials, dissipation of free energy is usually not directly considered, because the change in free energy is often negligible compared to the immense reservoir stored in neural transmembrane ion gradients and the long-term energy requirements are met through chemical energy, i.e., metabolism. However, these gradients can temporarily nearly vanish in neurological diseases, such as migraine and stroke, and in traumatic brain injury from concussions to severe injuries. We study biophysical neuron models based on the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) formalism extended to include time-dependent ion concentrations inside and outside the cell and metabolic energy-driven pumps. We reveal the basic mechanism of a state of free energy-starvation (FES) with bifurcation analyses showing that ion dynamics is for a large range of pump rates bistable without contact to an ion bath. This is interpreted as a threshold reduction of a new fundamental mechanism of ionic excitability that causes a long-lasting but transient FES as observed in pathological states. We can in particular conclude that a coupling of extracellular ion concentrations to a large glial-vascular bath can take a role as an inhibitory mechanism crucial in ion homeostasis, while the Na⁺/K⁺ pumps alone are insufficient to recover from FES. Our results provide the missing link between the HH formalism and activator-inhibitor models that have been successfully used for modeling migraine phenotypes, and therefore will allow us to validate the hypothesis that migraine symptoms are explained by disturbed function in ion channel subunits, Na⁺/K⁺ pumps, and other proteins that regulate ion homeostasis.},

  Abstract                 = {Modulation of extracellular potassium concentration ([K](o)) has a profound impact on the excitability of neurons and neuronal networks. In the CA3 region of the rat hippocampus synchronized epileptiform bursts occur in conditions of increased [K](o). The dynamic nature of spontaneous neuronal firing in high [K](o) is therefore of interest. One particular interest is the potential presence of bistable behaviors such as the coexistence of stable repetitive firing and fixed rest potential states generated in individual cells by the elevation of [K](o). The dynamics of repetitive activity generated by increased [K](o) is investigated in a 19-compartment hippocampal pyramidal cell (HPC) model and a related two-compartment reduced HPC model. Results are compared with those for the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in similar conditions. For neural models, [K](o) changes are simulated as a shift in the potassium reversal potential (E(K)). Using phase resetting and bifurcation analysis techniques, all three models are shown to have specific regions of E(K) that result in bistability. For activity in bistable parameter regions, stimulus parameters are identified that switch high-potassium model behavior from repetitive firing to a quiescent state. Bistability in the HPC models is limited to a very small parameter region. Consequently, our results suggest that it is likely some HPCs in networks exposed to high [K](o) continue to burst such that a stable, quiescent network state does not exist. In [K](o) ranges where HPCs are not bistable, the population may still exhibit bistable behaviors where synchronous population events are reversibly annihilated by phase resetting pulses, suggesting the existence of a nonsynchronous network attractor.},

In CA1, the peak [K(+)]o in stratum radiatum during 20� Hz stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers was significantly higher in Aqp4 (-/-) mice than in wild types, whereas no differences were observed throughout the [K(+)]o recovery phase. In stratum pyramidale and corpus callosum, neither peak [K(+)]o nor post-stimulus [K(+)]o recovery was affected by Aqp4 deletion. Our data suggest that AQP4 modulates [K(+)]o during synaptic stimulation through its effect on extracellular space volume.},

Using a mouse model with glia-specific deletion of Kcnj10, we have explored the mechanistic underpinning of the epilepsy phenotype. The gene deletion was shown to delay K(+) clearance after synaptic activation in stratum radiatum of hippocampal slices. The activity-dependent changes in extracellular space volume did not differ between Kcnj10 mutant and wild-type mice, indicating that the Kcnj10 gene product Kir4.1 mediates osmotically neutral K(+) clearance. Combined, our K(+) and extracellular volume recordings indicate that compromised K(+) spatial buffering in brain underlies the epilepsy phenotype associated with human KCNJ10 mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) shape the information flow from retina to cortex, presumably by controlling the number of visually evoked spikes in geniculate thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and refining their receptive field. The INs exhibit a rich variety of firing patterns: Depolarizing current injections to the soma may induce tonic firing, periodic bursting or an initial burst followed by tonic spiking, sometimes with prominent spike-time adaptation. When released from hyperpolarization, some INs elicit rebound bursts, while others return more passively to the resting potential. A full mechanistic understanding that explains the function of the dLGN on the basis of neuronal morphology, physiology and circuitry is currently lacking. One way to approach such an understanding is by developing a detailed mathematical model of the involved cells and their interactions. Limitations of the previous models for the INs of the dLGN region prevent an accurate� representation of the conceptual framework needed to understand the computational properties of this region. We here present a detailed compartmental model of INs using, for the first time, a morphological reconstruction and a set of active dendritic conductances constrained by experimental somatic recordings from INs under several different current-clamp conditions. The model makes a number of experimentally testable predictions about the role of specific mechanisms for the firing properties observed in these neurons. In addition to accounting for the significant features of all experimental traces, it quantitatively reproduces the experimental recordings of the action-potential- firing frequency as a function of injected current. We show how and why relative differences in conductance values, rather than differences in ion channel composition, could account for the distinct differences between the responses observed in two different neurons, suggesting that INs may be individually tuned to optimize network operation under different input conditions.},

We analyzed the extensive and finely divided processes of the protoplasmic astrocyte in the molecular layer of the rat dentate gyrus by means of computer electron tomography and stereo-photogrammetry using tilted high voltage electron microscope images of thick Golgi preparations. The surface area and volume of the astrocytic processes were measured and the surface/volume ratios were estimated. The surface/volume ratios of astrocytic processes in the neuropile ranged from 18.9 to 33.0 per microm, and the mean value was 26.2+/-5.0 per microm. The values were roughly comparable to those previously reported for the microdomain of Bergmann glia cell terminal processes in the rat cerebellum, which were estimated from reconstructions using thin serial section electron microscope images. The large surface to volume ratio of the astrocytic processes in the neuropile resulted from the lamellar nature of the processes interposed between other cellular elements, and may reflect the functional activities of the astrocyte. The results suggest the usefulness of the electron tomography and stereo-photogrammetry for three-dimensional morphometrical analysis of the astrocytic processes, although both techniques can be expected to be refined further in order to provide more precise measurements of these complicated processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Water transport properties of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) were studied in cultures of pigmented epithelial cells (PE) from the ciliary body of the eye. Here, the membrane that faces upwards contains NKCCs and can be subjected to rapid changes in bathing solution composition and osmolarity. The anatomy of the cultured cell layer was investigated by light and electron microscopy. The transport rate of the cotransporter was determined from the bumetanide-sensitive component of 86Rb+ uptake, and volume changes were derived from quenching of the fluorescent dye calcein. The water permeability (Lp) of the membrane was halved by the specific inhibitor bumetanide. The bumetanide-sensitive component of the water transport exhibited apparent saturation at osmotic gradients higher than 200 mosmol l-1. Cell shrinkages produced by NaCl or KCl were smaller than those elicited by equi-osmolar applications of mannitol, indicating reflection coefficients for these salts close to zero. The activation energy of the bumetanide-sensitive component of the Lp was 21 kcal mol-1, which is four times higher than that of an aqueous pore. The data suggest that osmotic transport via the cotransporter involves conformational changes of the cotransporter and interaction with Na+, K+ and Cl-. Similar measurements were performed on immortalized cell cultures from the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TALH). Given similar overall transport rates of bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+, the NKCCs of this tissue did not contribute any bumetanide-sensitive Lp. This suggests that the cotransporters of the two tissues are either different isoforms or the same cotransporter but in two different transport modes.},

These relative volume changes and parallel Ca2+ transients in single cells were examined by microspectrofluorimetry after loading the cells with fura-2/AM and varying the excitation wavelengths between the isosbestic point of the probe and its ion-sensitive wavelength. L(+)-2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) evoked an astroglial swelling but few or no cytosolic Ca2+ transients. No rapid swelling was observed after stimulation of ionotropic Glu receptors. The Glu-induced volume increase was unaffected by gluconate or amiloride, partially blocked by Glu-carrier blockers, and totally blocked by ketamine. The Glu- or L-AP4-induced volume increases were blocked by BaCl2 or furosemide. Tetraethylammoniumchloride-1-hydrate blocked the Glu- and 1S,3R-ACPD-induced astroglial swelling but the voltage-dependent L-, N-, or T-type Ca2+ channels were not primarily involved in the Glu-, 1S,3R-ACPD-, or L-AP4-induced swelling. mGluRs induce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis, intracellular Ca2+ increase, and the opening of a delayed outward K+ rectifier, and along another route they activate a Gi protein and open an inward K+ rectifier. One Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-)-cotransporter and a Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase is activated and so also is an electrogenic Na(+)-dependent Glu carrier. Thus, Glu-induced astroglial swelling is not only the result of the above mechanisms, but requires another, until now unidentified mechanism, probably some ketamine-sensitive K+ outflux or Na+ influx.},

  Abstract                 = {Glial cells are known to interact extensively with neuronal elements in the brain, influencing their activity. Astrocytes associated with synapses integrate neuronal inputs and release transmitters that modulate synaptic sensitivity. Glial cells participate in formation and rebuilding of synapses and play a prominent role in protection and repair of nervous tissue after damage. For glial cells to take an active part in plastic alterations under physiological conditions and pathological disturbances, extensive specific signaling, both within single cells and between cells, is required. In recent years, intensive research has led to our first insight into this signaling. We know there are active connections between astrocytes in the form of networks promoting Ca2+ and ATP signaling; we also know there is intense signaling between astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, with an array of molecules acting as signaling substances. The cells must be functionally integrated to facilitate the enormous dynamics of and capacity for reconstruction within the nervous system. In this paper, we summarize some basic data on glial neuronal signaling to provide insight into synaptic modulation and reconstruction in physiology and protection and repair after damage.},

The obligatory, coupled cotransports of Na(+), K(+) and Cl(-) (NKCC1) and of Na(+) and K(+) (NKATPase) effect net cellular K(+) influx. We examined the effects of specific inhibitors of these transports; a cardiac glycoside (Digoxin) and a loop diuretic (Furosemide) on virus replication in vitro. The replication of the DNA viruses, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, human cytomegalovirus and adenovirus was inhibited. There was normal replication of the RNA virus encephalomyocarditis virus. Antiviral activities of both drugs were influenced by extracellular K(+). Antiviral effects were most potent when Digoxin and Furosemide were used in combination. Targeting the host cell in this way is fundamentally different to other antiviral drug developments to date and we propose the descriptive term Ionic Contra Viral Therapy (ICVT) for the purpose of definition. We believe that specific inhibitors of coupled K(+) transports merit controlled clinical trial for a broad spectrum of DNA virus infections by local application.},

  Abstract                 = {The postsynaptic neuronal dendrite is selectively vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and glutamate receptor overactivation. We explored the glutamate receptor pharmacology and ionic basis of rapid, reversible alterations in dendritic shape which occur in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate. Dendrite morphology was assessed with the fluorescent membrane tracer, DiI, or immunofluorescence labeling of the somatodendritic protein, MAP2. Cortical cultures derived from 15-day-old mouse embryos underwent segmental dendritic beading when exposed to NMDA, AMPA, or kainate, but not to metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists. Varicosity formation in response to NMDA or kainate application was substantially attenuated in reduced sodium buffer (substituted with N-methyl-D-glucamine). Furthermore, veratridine-induced sodium entry mimicked excitotoxic alterations in dendrites and additionally caused varicosity formation in axons. Solutions deficient in chloride (substituted with Na methylsulfate) and antagonists of chloride-permeable GABA/glycine receptors reduced NMDA- or kainate-induced varicosity formation. An increase in dendrite volume was observed as varicosities formed, and varicosity formation was attenuated in sucrose-supplemented hypertonic media. Despite marked structural changes affecting virtually all neurons, dendrite shape returned to normal within 2 h of terminating glutamate receptor agonist application. Neurons exposed to kainate recovered more rapidly than those exposed to NMDA, and neurons exposed to NMDA in calcium-free buffer recovered more rapidly than cells treated with NMDA in normal buffer. While sodium, chloride, and water entry contribute to excitotoxic dendritic injury acutely, calcium entry through NMDA receptors results in lasting structural changes in damaged dendrites.},

  Abstract                 = {The thick-tufted layer 5b pyramidal cell extends its dendritic tree to all six layers of the mammalian neocortex and serves as a major building block for the cortical column. L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na(+)-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca(2+) spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca(2+) spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.},

The interplay between dendritic nonlinearities and recurrent cortical microcircuit activity in shaping network response is largely unknown. We simulated detailed conductance-based models of TTCs forming recurrent microcircuits that were interconnected as found experimentally; the network was embedded in a realistic background synaptic activity. TTCs microcircuits significantly amplified brief thalamocortical inputs; this cortical gain was mediated by back-propagation activated N-methyl-d-aspartate depolarizations and dendritic back-propagation-activated Ca(2+) spike firing, ignited by the coincidence of thalamic-activated somatic spike and local dendritic synaptic inputs, originating from the cortical microcircuit. Surprisingly, dendritic nonlinearities in TTCs microcircuits linearly multiplied thalamic inputs-amplifying them while maintaining input selectivity. Our findings indicate that dendritic nonlinearities are pivotal in controlling the gain and the computational functions of TTCs microcircuits, which serve as a dominant output source for the neocortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain excitation increases neuronal Na(+) concentration by 2 major mechanisms: (i) Na(+) influx caused by glutamatergic synaptic activity; and (ii) action-potential-mediated depolarization by Na(+) influx followed by repolarizating K(+) efflux, increasing extracellular K(+) concentration. This review deals mainly with the latter and it concludes that clearance of extracellular K(+) is initially mainly effectuated by Na(+),K(+)-ATPase-mediated K(+) uptake into astrocytes, at K(+) concentrations above \~{}10 mM aided by uptake of Na(+),K(+) and 2 Cl(-) by the cotransporter NKCC1. Since operation of the astrocytic Na(+),K(+)-ATPase requires K(+)-dependent glycogenolysis for stimulation of the intracellular ATPase site, it ceases after normalization of extracellular K(+) concentration. This allows K(+) release via the inward rectifying K(+) channel Kir4.1, perhaps after trans-astrocytic connexin- and/or pannexin-mediated K(+) transfer, which would be a key candidate for determination by synchronization-based computational analysis and may have signaling effects. Spatially dispersed K(+) release would have little effect on extracellular K(+) concentration and allow K(+) accumulation by the less powerful neuronal Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, which is not stimulated by increases in extracellular K(+). Since the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase exchanges 3 Na(+) with 2 K(+), it creates extracellular hypertonicity and cell shrinkage. Hypertonicity stimulates NKCC1, which, aided by $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, causes regulatory volume increase, furosemide-inhibited undershoot in [K(+)]e and perhaps facilitation of the termination of slow neuronal hyperpolarization (sAHP), with behavioral consequences. The ion transport processes involved minimize ionic disequilibria caused by the asymmetric Na(+),K(+)-ATPase fluxes.},

  Abstract                 = {The inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit Kir5.1 is expressed abundantly in the brain, but its precise distribution and function are still largely unknown. Because Kir5.1 is co-expressed with Kir4.1 in retinal glial Muller cells, we have compared the biochemical and immunological properties of Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 in the mouse brain. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that brain expressed at least two subsets of Kir channels, heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1. Immunolabeling using specific antibodies showed that channels comprising Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 subunits were assembled in a region-specific fashion. Heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 was identified in the neocortex and in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Homomeric Kir4.1 was confined to the hippocampus and the thalamus. Homomeric Kir5.1 was not identified. Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 expression appeared to occur only in astrocytes, specifically in the membrane domains facing the pia mater and blood vessels or in the processes surrounding synapses. Both Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 could be associated with PDZ domain-containing syntrophins, which might be involved in the subcellular targeting of these astrocyte Kir channels. Because heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1 have distinct ion channel properties (Tanemoto, M., Kittaka, N., Inanobe, A., and Kurachi, Y. (2000) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 525, 587-592 and Tucker, S. J., Imbrici, P., Salvatore, L., D'Adamo, M. C., and Pessia, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 16404-16407), it is plausible that these channels play differential physiological roles in the K+ -buffering action of brain astrocytes in a region-specific manner.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies showed that furosemide blocks spontaneous epileptiform activity without diminishing synaptic transmission or reducing hyperexcited field responses to electrical stimuli. We now test the hypothesis that the antiepileptic effects of furosemide are mediated through its blockade of the Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransporter and thus should be mimicked by a reduction of extracellular chloride ([Cl-]o). In the first set of experiments, field recordings from the CA1 cell body layer of hippocampal slices showed that spontaneous bursting developed within 10-20 min in slices perfused with low-[Cl-]o (7 mM) medium but that this spontaneous epileptiform activity ceased after a further 10-20 min. Intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells showed that normal action potential discharge could be elicited by membrane depolarization, even after the tissue was perfused with low-[Cl-]o medium for >2 h. In a second set of experiments, spontaneous bursting activity was induced in slices by perfusion with high-[K+]o (10 mM), bicuculline (100 microM), or 4-aminopyridine (100 microM). In each case, recordings from the CA1 region showed that reduction of [Cl-]o to 21 mM reversibly blocked the bursting within 1 h. Similar to previous observations with furosemide treatment, low-[Cl-]o medium blocked spontaneous hypersynchronous discharges without reducing synaptic hyperexcitability (i.e., hyperexcitable field responses evoked by electrical stimulation). In a third set of experiments, prolonged exposure (>1 h after spontaneous bursting ceased) of slices to systematically varied [Cl-]o and [K+]o resulted in one of three types of events: 1) spontaneous, long-lasting, and repetitive negative field potential shifts (7 mM [Cl-]o; 3 mM [K+]o); 2) oscillations consisting of 5- to 10-mV negative shifts in the field potential, with a period of approximately 1 cycle/40 s (16 mM [Cl-]o; 12 mM [K+]o); and 3) shorter, infrequently occurring negative field shifts lasting 20-40 s (21 mM [Cl-]o; 3 mM [K+]o). Our observations indicate that the effects of low [Cl-]o on neuronal synchronization and spontaneous discharge are time dependent. Similar effects were seen with furosemide and low [Cl-]o, consistent with the hypothesis that the antiepileptic effect of furosemide is mediated by the drug's effect on chloride transporters. Finally, the results of altering extracellular potassium along with chloride suggest that blockade of the Na+, K+,2Cl- cotransporter, which normally transports chloride from the extracellular space into glial cells, is key to these antiepileptic effects.},

  Abstract                 = {A general theory views the function of all neurons as prediction, and one component of this theory is that of "predictive homeostasis" or "prediction error." It is well established that sensory systems adapt so that neuronal output maintains sensitivity to sensory input, in accord with information theory. Predictive homeostasis applies the same principle at the cellular level, where the challenge is to maintain membrane excitability at the optimal homeostatic level so that spike generation is maximally sensitive to small gradations in synaptic drive. Negative feedback is a hallmark of homeostatic mechanisms, as exemplified by depolarization-activated potassium channels. In contrast, T-type calcium channels exhibit positive feedback that appears at odds with the theory. In thalamocortical neurons of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), T-type channels are capable of causing bursts of spikes with an all-or-none character in response to excitation from a hyperpolarized potential. This "burst mode" would partially uncouple visual input from spike output and reduce the information spikes convey about gradations in visual input. However, past observations of T-type-driven bursts may have resulted from unnaturally high membrane excitability. Here we have mimicked within rat brain slices the patterns of synaptic conductance that occur naturally during vision. In support of the theory of predictive homeostasis, we found that T-type channels restored excitability toward its homeostatic level during periods of hyperpolarization. Thus, activation of T-type channels allowed two retinal input spikes to cause one output spike on average, and we observed almost no instances in which output count exceeded input count (a "burst"). T-type calcium channels therefore help to maintain a single optimal mode of transmission rather than creating a second mode. More fundamentally our results support the general theory, which seeks to predict the properties of a neuron's ion channels and synapses given knowledge of natural patterns of synaptic input.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Stroke is the neurological evidence of a critical reduction of cerebral blood flow in a circumscribed part of the brain, resulting from the sudden or gradually progressing obstruction of a large brain artery. Treatment of stroke requires the solid understanding of stroke pathophysiology and involves a broad range of hemodynamic and molecular interventions. This review summarizes research that has been carried out in many laboratories over a long period of time, but the main focus will be on own experimental research. 2. The first chapter deals with the hemodynamics of focal ischemia with particular emphasis on the collateral circulation of the brain, the regulation of blood flow and the microcirculation. In the second chapter the penumbra concept of ischemia is discussed, providing a detailed list of the physiological, biochemical and structural viability thresholds of ischemia and examples of how these thresholds can be applied for imaging the penumbra. The third chapter summarizes the pathophysiology of infarct progression, focusing on the role of peri-infarct depolarisation, the multitude of putative molecular injury pathways, brain edema and inflammation. Finally, the fourth chapter provides an overview of currently discussed therapeutic approaches, notably the effect of mechanical or thrombolytic reperfusion, arteriogenesis, pharmacological neuroprotection, ischemic preconditioning and regeneration. 3. The main emphasis of the review is placed on the balanced differentiation between hemodynamic and molecular factors contributing to the manifestation of ischemic injury in order to provide a rational basis for future therapeutic interventions.},

To address this issue, models have been proposed that invoke the charge conservation principle to calculate V(m) from ion concentrations ("algebraic" method), rather than from transmembrane current ("differential" method). The aims of this study are to compare model behavior during prolonged periods of pacing using the algebraic and differential methods, and to address the issue of model drift. We pace the Luo-Rudy dynamic model of a cardiac ventricular cell and compare the time-dependent behavior of computed parameters using the algebraic and differential methods. When ions carried by the stimulus current are taken into account, the algebraic and differential methods yield identical results and neither shows drift in computed parameters. The present study establishes the proper pacing protocol for simulation studies of cellular behavior during long periods of rapid pacing. Such studies are essential for mechanistic understanding of arrhythmogenesis, since cells are subjected to rapid periodic stimulation during many arrhythmias.},

  Abstract                 = {The brain is a heterogeneous organ with regionally varied and constantly changing energetic needs. Blood vessels in the brain are equipped with control mechanisms that match oxygen and glucose delivery through blood flow with the local metabolic demands that are imposed by neural activity. However, the cellular bases of this mechanism have remained elusive. A major advance has been the demonstration that astrocytes, cells with extensive contacts with both synapses and cerebral blood vessels, participate in the increases in flow evoked by synaptic activity. Their organization in nonoverlapping spatial domains indicates that they are uniquely positioned to shape the spatial distribution of the vascular responses that are evoked by neural activity. Astrocytic calcium is an important determinant of microvascular function and may regulate flow independently of synaptic activity. The involvement of astrocytes in neurovascular coupling has broad implications for the interpretation of functional imaging signals and for the understanding of brain diseases that are associated with neurovascular dysfunction.},

  Abstract                 = {In the CNS, prolonged activation of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) has been shown to evoke biphasic postsynaptic responses, consisting of an initial hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization. A potential mechanism underlying the depolarization is an acute chloride (Cl(-)) accumulation resulting in a shift of the GABA(A) reversal potential (E(GABA)). The amount of GABA-evoked Cl(-) accumulation and accompanying depolarization depends on presynaptic and postsynaptic properties of GABAergic transmission, as well as on cellular morphology and regulation of Cl(-) intracellular concentration ([Cl(-)](i)). To analyze the influence of these factors on the Cl(-) and voltage behavior, we studied spatiotemporal dynamics of activity-dependent [Cl(-)](i) changes in multicompartmental models of hippocampal cells based on realistic morphological data. Simulated Cl(-) influx through GABA(A) Rs was able to exceed physiological Cl(-) extrusion rates thereby evoking HCO(3)(-) -dependent E(GABA) shift and depolarizing responses. Depolarizations were observed in spite of GABA(A) receptor desensitization. The amplitude of the depolarization was frequency-dependent and determined by intracellular Cl(-) accumulation. Changes in the dendritic diameter and in the speed of GABA clearance in the synaptic cleft were significant sources of depolarization variability. In morphologically reconstructed granule cells subjected to an intense GABAergic background activity, dendritic inhibition was more affected by accumulation of intracellular Cl(-) than somatic inhibition. Interestingly, E(GABA) changes induced by activation of a single dendritic synapse propagated beyond the site of Cl(-) influx and affected neighboring synapses. The simulations suggest that E(GABA) may differ even along a single dendrite supporting the idea that it is necessary to assign E(GABA) to a given GABAergic input and not to a given neuron.},

Ion channels for Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl- ion antiport 3Na/Ca, and "active" ion pumps were represented in the neuron membrane. The glia had "leak" conductances and an ion pump. Fluxes, concentration changes and cell swelling were computed. The neuron was stimulated by injecting current. Afterdischarge (AD) followed stimulation if depolarization due to rising interstitial K+ concentration ([K+]o) activated persistent Na+ current (INa.P). AD was either simple or self-regenerating; either regular (tonic) or burst-type (clonic); and always self-limiting. Self-regenerating AD required sufficient INa.P to ensure re-excitation. Burst firing depended on activation of dendritic Ca2+ currents and Ca-dependent K+ current. Varying glial buffer function influenced [K+]o accumulation and afterdischarge duration. Variations in Na+ and K+ currents influenced the threshold and the duration of AD. The data show that high [K+]o and intrinsic membrane currents can produce the feedback of self-regenerating afterdischarges without synaptic input.

  Abstract                 = {In spite of five decades of study, the biophysics of spreading depression (SD) is incompletely understood. Earlier we have modeled seizures and SD, and we have shown that currents through ion channels normally present in neuron membranes can generate SD-like depolarization. In the present study, we define the conditions for triggering SD and the parameters that influence its course in a model of a hippocampal pyramidal cell with more complete representation of ions and channels than the previous version. "Leak" conductances for Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) and an ion pump were present in the membrane of the entire cell; fast inactivating voltage dependent conductances for sodium and potassium in the soma; "persistent" conductances in soma and apical dendrite, and K(+)- and voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-controlled conductance in the apical dendrite. The neuron was surrounded by restricted interstitial space and by a "glia-endothelium" system of extracellular ion regulation bounded by a membrane having leak conductances and an ion pump. Ion fluxes and concentration changes were continuously computed as well as osmotic cell volume changes. As long as reuptake into the neuron and "buffering" by glia kept pace with K(+) released from the neuron, stimulating current applied to the soma evoked repetitive firing that stopped when stimulation ceased. When glial uptake was reduced, K(+) released from neurons could accumulate in the interstitium and keep the neuron depolarized so that strong depolarizing pulses injected into the soma were followed either by afterdischarge or SD. SD-like depolarization was ignited when depolarization spreading into the apical dendrite, activated persistent Na(+) current and NMDA-controlled current. With membrane parameters constant, varying the injected stimulating current influenced SD onset but neither the depolarization nor the increase in extracellular K(+). Glial "leak" conductance influenced SD duration and SD ignition point. Varying maximal conductances (representing channel density) also influenced SD onset time but not the amplitude of the depolarization. Hypoxia was simulated by turning off the Na-K exchange pump, and this resulted in SD-like depolarization. The results confirm that, once ignited, SD runs an all-or-none trajectory, the level of depolarization is governed by feedback involving ion shifts and glutamate acting on ion channels and not by the number of channels open, and SD is ignited if the net persistent membrane current in the apical dendrites turns inward.},

It is not known whether these currents flow through abnormally operating physiological ion channels or through pathological pathways that are not normally present. We have now used the NEURON simulating environment of Hines, Moore, and Carnevale to model seizure discharges and SD. The geometry and electrotonic properties of the model neuron conformed to a hippocampal pyramidal cell. Voltage-controlled transient and persistent sodium currents (I(Na,T) and I(Na,P)), potassium currents (I(K,DR) and I(K,A)), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-controlled currents (I(NMDA)), were inserted in the appropriate regions of the model cell. The neuron was surrounded by an interstitial space where extracellular potassium and sodium concentration ([K(+)](o) and [Na(+)](o)) could rise or fall. Changes in intra- and extracellular ion concentrations and the resulting shifts in the driving force for ionic currents were continuously computed based on the amount of current flowing through the membrane. A Na-K exchange pump operated to restore ion balances. In addition, extracellular potassium concentration, [K(+)](o), was also controlled by a "glial" uptake function. Parameters were chosen to resemble experimental data. As long as [K(+)](o) was kept within limits by the activity of the Na-K pump and the "glial" uptake, a depolarizing current pulse applied to the cell soma evoked repetitive firing that ceased when the stimulating current stopped. If, however, [K(+)](o) was allowed to rise, then a brief pulse provoked firing that outlasted the stimulus. At the termination of such a burst, the cell hyperpolarized and then slowly depolarized and another burst erupted without outside intervention. Such "clonic" bursting could continue indefinitely maintained by an interplay of the rise and fall of potassium and sodium concentrations with membrane currents and threshold levels.

We conclude that epileptiform neuronal behavior and SD-like depolarization can be generated by the feedback of ion currents that change ion concentrations, which, in turn, influence ion currents and membrane potentials.

  Abstract                 = {The regulation of Cl(-) transport into and out of cells plays a critical role in the maintenance of intracellular volume and the excitability of GABA responsive neurons. The molecular determinants of these seemingly diverse processes are related ion cotransporters: Cl(-) influx is mediated by the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 and Cl(-) efflux via K-Cl cotransporters, KCC1 or KCC2. A Cl(-)/volume-sensitive kinase has been proposed to coordinately regulate these activities via altered phosphorylation of the transporters; phosphorylation activates NKCC1 while inhibiting KCCs, and dephosphorylation has the opposite effects. We show that WNK3, a member of the WNK family of serine-threonine kinases, colocalizes with NKCC1 and KCC1/2 in diverse Cl(-)-transporting epithelia and in neurons expressing ionotropic GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and reticular activating system. By expression studies in Xenopus oocytes, we show that kinase-active WNK3 increases Cl(-) influx via NKCC1, and that it inhibits Cl(-) exit through KCC1 and KCC2; kinase-inactive WNK3 has the opposite effects. WNK3's effects are imparted via altered phosphorylation and surface expression of its downstream targets and bypass the normal requirement of altered tonicity for activation of these transporters. Together, these data indicate that WNK3 can modulate the level of intracellular Cl(-) via opposing actions on entry and exit pathways. They suggest that WNK3 is part of the Cl(-)/volume-sensing mechanism necessary for the maintenance of cell volume during osmotic stress and the dynamic modulation of GABA neurotransmission.},

We show that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induces cultured astrocytes to grow processes and that Ras family GTPases mediate these morphological changes. Activated alleles of rac1 and rhoA blocked and reversed bFGF effects when introduced into astrocytes in dissociated culture and in brain slices using recombinant adenoviruses. By contrast, dominant negative (DN) alleles of both GTPases mimicked bFGF effects. A DN allele of Ha-ras blocked bFGF effects but not those of Rac1-DN or RhoA-DN. Our results show that bFGF acting through c-Ha-Ras inhibits endogenous Rac1 and RhoA GTPases thereby triggering astrocyte process growth, and they provide evidence for the regulation of this cascade in vivo by a yet undetermined neuron-derived factor.},

  Abstract                 = {Deletion studies in transgenic mice indicate that the potassium inward rectifying channel Kir4.1 is crucial for oligodendrocyte differentiation and has a special role in regulation of extracellular potassium (K(+)), a major function of astrocytes. However, there are conflicting reports on whether Kir4.1 is expressed by white matter astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, raising doubts over its functions. Here, we have examined Kir4.1 expression in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes of the rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white matter tract. Single and double immunofluorescence labelling was performed on frozen sections from optic nerves aged postnatal day (P)5, 10, 15, 20 and adult, using anti-Kir4.1 antibodies and the glia-specific antibodies glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, astrocytes), carbonic anhydrase II (CAII, oligodendrocyte somata and processes) and myelin basic protein (MBP, oligodendrocyte myelin sheaths). The results demonstrate Kir4.1 expression in rows of glial cells as early as P5, and this pattern persisted throughout development and into adulthood, consistent with early expression of Kir4.1 on developing oligodendrocytes. Clear co-expression of Kir4.1 and GFAP is first evident at P10 and increases to adult levels by P15 and P20, which correlates with the development of K(+) regulation between P15 and P20. Astrocyte expression of Kir4.1 is localized to perivascular end-feet and fine processes within the fascicles of myelinated axons, consistent with a role in K(+) spatial buffering between nodes of Ranvier and blood vessels. By contrast, Kir4.1 is concentrated in the cell bodies of oligodendrocytes, and there is no apparent co-expression with MBP(+) myelin sheaths, suggesting oligodendroglial Kir4.1 channels are not involved in K(+) regulation. The results support roles for Kir4.1 in both oligodendrocyte differentiation and K(+) regulation by astrocytes.},

abstract = {Spreading depression (SD) is a transient wave of near-complete neuronal and glial depolarization associated with massive transmembrane ionic and water shifts. It is evolutionarily conserved in the central nervous systems of a wide variety of species from locust to human. The depolarization spreads slowly at a rate of only millimeters per minute by way of grey matter contiguity, irrespective of functional or vascular divisions, and lasts up to a minute in otherwise normal tissue. As such, SD is a radically different breed of electrophysiological activity compared with everyday neural activity, such as action potentials and synaptic transmission. Seventy years after its discovery by Le?o, the mechanisms of SD and its profound metabolic and hemodynamic effects are still debated. What we did learn of consequence, however, is that SD plays a central role in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases including migraine, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury. An intriguing overlap among them is that they are all neurovascular disorders. Therefore, the interplay between neurons and vascular elements is critical for our understanding of the impact of this homeostatic breakdown in patients. The challenges of translating experimental data into human pathophysiology notwithstanding, this review provides a detailed account of bidirectional interactions between brain parenchyma and the cerebral vasculature during SD and puts this in the context of neurovascular diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {An integrated methodology is developed for the theoretical analysis of solute transport and reaction in cellular biological media, such as tissues, microbial flocs, and biofilms. First, the method of local spatial averaging with a weight function is used to establish the equation which describes solute conservation at the cellular biological medium scale, starting with a continuum-based formulation of solute transport at finer spatial scales. Second, an effective-medium model is developed for the self-consistent calculation of the local diffusion coefficient in the cellular biological medium, including the effects of the structural heterogeneity of the extra-cellular space and the reversible adsorption to extra-cellular polymers. The final expression for the local effective diffusion coefficient is: D(Abeta)=lambda(beta)D(Aupsilon), where D(Aupsilon) is the diffusion coefficient in water, and lambda(beta) is a function of the composition and fundamental geometric and physicochemical system properties, including the size of solute molecules, the size of extra-cellular polymer fibers, and the mass permeability of the cell membrane. Furthermore, the analysis sheds some light on the function of the extra-cellular hydrogel as a diffusive barrier to solute molecules approaching the cell membrane, and its implications on the transport of chemotherapeutic agents within a cellular biological medium. Finally, the model predicts the qualitative trend as well as the quantitative variability of a large number of published experimental data on the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in cell-entrapping gels, microbial flocs, biofilms, and mammalian tissues.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been suggestions that heat caused by cerebral metabolic activity may constrain mammalian brain evolution, architecture, and function. This article investigates physical limits on brain wiring and corresponding changes in brain temperature that are imposed by thermodynamics of heat balance determined mainly by Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, cerebral blood flow, and heat conduction. It is found that even moderate firing rates cause significant intracellular Na(+) build-up, and the ATP consumption rate associated with pumping out these ions grows nonlinearly with frequency. Surprisingly, the power dissipated by the Na(+)/K(+) pump depends biphasically on frequency, which can lead to the biphasic dependence of brain temperature on frequency as well. Both the total power of sodium pumps and brain temperature diverge for very small fiber diameters, indicating that too thin fibers are not beneficial for thermal balance. For very small brains blood flow is not a sufficient cooling mechanism deep in the brain. The theoretical lower bound on fiber diameter above which brain temperature is in the operational regime is strongly frequency dependent but finite due to synaptic depression. For normal neurophysiological conditions this bound is at least an order of magnitude smaller than average values of empirical fiber diameters, suggesting that neuroanatomy of the mammalian brains operates in the thermodynamically safe regime. Analytical formulas presented can be used to estimate average firing rates in mammals, and relate their changes to changes in brain temperature, which can have important practical applications. In general, activity in larger brains is found to be slower than in smaller brains.},

We have proposed that one reason may be the release of excitatory amino acids (EAA) via volume-activated anion channels (VRACs) that are activated by such swelling. This release could be a target for therapy, which could involve blocking the astrocytic swelling or the release mechanisms. The transport mechanisms likely causing the early astrocytic swelling are therefore summarized. In terms of targeting the release mechanisms, we have found a potent inhibitor of VRACs, tamoxifen, to be strongly neuroprotective in focal ischemia with a therapeutic window of 3 h after initiation of the ischemia. The question, however, of whether neuroprotection by tamoxifen can be solely attributed to VRAC inhibition in astrocytes has yet to be resolved.},

Using ion-selective microelectrodes we investigated the effects of barium on rises in [K+]o induced by repetitive alvear stimulation in slices from surgically removed hippocampi with and without Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS and non-AHS). In non-AHS tissue, barium augmented rises in [K+]o by 147\% and prolonged the half time of recovery by 90\%. The barium effect was reversible, concentration dependent, and persisted in the presence of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA(A)] receptor antagonists. In AHS tissue, barium caused a decrease in the baseline level of [K+]o. In contrast to non-AHS slices, in AHS slices with intact synaptic transmission, barium had no effect on the stimulus-induced rises of [K+]o, and the half time of recovery from the rise was less prolonged (by 57\%). Under conditions of blocked synaptic transmission, barium augmented stimulus-induced rises in [K+]o, but only by 40\%. In both tissues, barium significantly reduced negative slow-field potentials following repetitive stimulation but did not alter the mean population spike amplitude. The findings suggest a significant contribution of glial barium-sensitive K+-channels to K+-buffering in non-AHS tissue and an impairment of glial barium-sensitive K+-uptake in AHS tissue.},

Emerging evidence implicates astrocytes as one of the key players in coordinating this neurovascular coupling. Astrocytes are poised to sense glutamatergic synaptic activity over a large spatial domain via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and subsequent calcium signaling and via energy-dependent glutamate transport. Astrocyte foot processes can signal vascular smooth muscle by arachidonic acid pathways involving astrocytic cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, astrocytic cyclooxygenase-1 and smooth muscle cytochrome P450 omega-hydroxylase activities, and by astrocytic and smooth muscle potassium channels. Non-glutamatergic transmitters released from neurons, such as nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites and vasoactive intestinal peptide, might modulate neurovascular signaling at the level of the astrocyte or smooth muscle. Thus, astrocytes have a pivotal role in dynamic signaling within the neurovascular unit. Important questions remain on how this signaling is integrated with other pathways in health and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand the role of different K(+) channel subtypes in glial cell-mediated spatial buffering of extracellular K(+), immunohistochemical localization of inwardly rectifying K(+) channel subunits (Kir2.1, Kir2.2, Kir2.3, Kir4.1, and Kir5.1) was performed in the retina of the mouse. Stainings were found for the weakly inward-rectifying K(+) channel subunit Kir4.1 and for the strongly inward-rectifying K(+) channel subunit Kir2.1. The most prominent labeling of the Kir4.1 protein was found in the endfoot membranes of M\"{u}ller glial cells facing the vitreous body and surrounding retinal blood vessels. Discrete punctate label was observed throughout all retinal layers and at the outer limiting membrane. By contrast, Kir2.1 immunoreactivity was located predominantly in the membrane domains of M\"{u}ller cells that contact retinal neurons, i.e., along the two stem processes, over the soma, and in the side branches extending into the synaptic layers. The results suggest a model in which the glial cell-mediated transport of extracellular K(+) away from excited neurons is mediated by the cooperation of different Kir channel subtypes. Weakly rectifying Kir channels (Kir4.1) are expressed predominantly in membrane domains where K(+) currents leave the glial cells and enter extracellular "sinks," whereas K(+) influxes from neuronal "sources" into glial cells are mediated mainly by strongly rectifying Kir channels (Kir 2.1). The expression of strongly rectifying Kir channels along the "cables" for spatial buffering currents may prevent an unwarranted outward leak of K(+), and, thus, avoid disturbances of neuronal information processing.},

To further assess the role of Kir4.1 in the retina, we generated a mouse line with targeted disruption of the Kir4.1 gene (Kir4.1 -/-). M\"{u}ller cells from Kir4.1 -/- mice were not labeled with an anti-Kir4.1 antibody, although they appeared morphologically normal when stained with an anti-glutamine synthetase antibody. In contrast, in M\"{u}ller cells from wild-type littermate (Kir4.1 +/+) mice, Kir4.1 was present and localized to the proximal endfeet and perivascular processes. In situ whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed a 10-fold increase in the input resistance and a large depolarization of Kir4.1 -/- M\"{u}ller cells compared with Kir4.1 +/+ cells. The slow PIII response of the light-evoked electroretinogram (ERG), which is generated by K(+) fluxes through M\"{u}ller cells, was totally absent in retinas from Kir4.1 -/- mice. The b-wave of the ERG, in contrast, was spared in the null mice. Overall, these results indicate that Kir4.1 is the principal K(+) channel subunit expressed in mouse M\"{u}ller glial cells. The highly regulated localization and the functional properties of Kir4.1 in M\"{u}ller cells suggest the involvement of this channel in the regulation of extracellular K(+) in the mouse retina.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid changes in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+](o)) in the mammalian CNS are counteracted by simple passive diffusion as well as by cellular mechanisms of K+ clearance. Buffering of [K+](o) can occur via glial or neuronal uptake of K+ ions through transporters or K+-selective channels. The best studied mechanism for [K+](o) buffering in the brain is called K+ spatial buffering, wherein the glial syncytium disperses local extracellular K+ increases by transferring K+ ions from sites of elevated [K+](o) to those with lower [K+](o). In recent years, K+ spatial buffering has been implicated or directly demonstrated by a variety of experimental approaches including electrophysiological and optical methods. A specialized form of spatial buffering named K+ siphoning takes place in the vertebrate retina, where glial Muller cells express inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir channels) positioned in the membrane domains near to the vitreous humor and blood vessels. This highly compartmentalized distribution of Kir channels in retinal glia directs K+ ions from the synaptic layers to the vitreous humor and blood vessels. Here, we review the principal mechanisms of [K+](o) buffering in the CNS and recent molecular studies on the structure and functions of glial Kir channels. We also discuss intriguing new data that suggest a close physical and functional relationship between Kir and water channels in glial cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Hereditary kidney diseases have long been an enigma with respect to the identity of the mutated genes and the mechanisms by which they develop. Recently, the podocyte has been identified as a primary target in both genetic and acquired glomerular disorders. Mutations discovered by Winn et al. and Reiser et al. in the gene encoding TRPC6, a non-selective cation channel of the TRP family expressed in podocyte foot processes, have been shown to cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. It remains to be determined whether these mutations lead to (i) impaired channel function that initiates a new pathogenic mechanism or (ii) decreased ability of the podocyte to adapt to normal physiological challenges that account for disease development, as suggested for other late-onset autosomal-dominant podocyte disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {Stationary and nonstationary spatiotemporal pattern formations emerging from the cellular electric activity are a common feature of biological cells and tissues. The nonstationary ones are well explained in the framework of the cable model. Inversely, the formation of the widespread self-organized stationary patterns of transcellular ionic currents remains elusive, despite their importance in cell polarization, apical growth, and morphogenesis. For example, the nature of the breaking symmetry in the Fucus zygote, a model organism for the experimental investigation of embryonic pattern formation, is still an open question. Using an electrodiffusive model, we report here an unexpected property of the cellular electric activity: a phase-space domain that gives rise to stationary patterns of transcellular ionic currents at finite wavelength. The cable model cannot predict this instability. In agreement with experiments, the characteristic time is an ionic diffusive one (<2 min). The critical radius is of the same order of magnitude as the cell radius (30 microm). The generic salient features are a global positive differential conductance, a negative differential conductance for one ion, and a difference between the diffusive coefficients. Although different, this mechanism is reminiscent of Turing instability.},

The anomalous subdiffusion is modelled by replacing diffusion constants with time dependent operators parameterized by fractional order exponents. Solutions are obtained as functions of the scaling parameters for infinite cables and semi-infinite cables with instantaneous current injections. Voltage attenuation along dendrites in response to alpha function synaptic inputs is computed. Action potential firing rates are also derived based on simple integrate and fire versions of the models. Our results show that electrotonic properties and firing rates of nerve cells are altered by anomalous subdiffusion in these models. We have suggested electrophysiological experiments to calibrate and validate the models.},

  Abstract                 = {Increases in astroglial Cl- conductance accompany changes in cell morphology and disassembly of cytoskeletal actin, but Cl- channels underlying these conductance increases have not been described. We characterize an outwardly rectifying Cl- channel in rodent neocortical cultured astrocytes and describe how cell shape and cytoskeletal actin modulate channel gating. In inside-out patch-clamp recordings from cultured astrocytes, outwardly rectifying Cl- channels either were spontaneously active or inducible in quiescent patches by depolarizing voltage steps. Average single-channel conductance was 36 pS between -60 and -80 mV and was 75 pS between 60 and 80 mV in symmetrical (150 mM NaCl) solutions. The permeability ratio (PNa/PCl) was 0.14 at lower ionic strength but increased at higher salt concentrations. Both ATP and 4, 4-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid produced a flicker block, whereas Zn2+ produced complete inhibition of channel activity. The frequency of observing both spontaneous and inducible Cl- channel activity was markedly higher in stellate than in flat, polygonally shaped astrocytes. In addition, cytoskeletal actin modulated channel open-state probability (PO) and conductance at negative membrane potentials, controlling the degree of outward rectification. Direct application of phalloidin, which stabilizes actin, preserved low PO and promoted lower conductance levels at negative potentials. Lower PO also was induced by direct application of polymerized actin. The actions of phalloidin and actin were reversed by coapplication of gelsolin and cytochalasin D, respectively. These results provide the first report of an outwardly rectifying Cl- channel in neocortical astrocytes and demonstrate how changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal actin may control Cl- conductance in these cells.},

However, a complete thermodynamic analysis of basal and stimulated K-Cl cotransport, at constant cell volume, is missing. This study was performed in low K sheep red blood cells before and after reducing cellular free Mg into the nanomolar range with the divalent cation ionophore A23187 and a chelator, an intervention known to stimulate K-Cl cotransport. The anion exchange inhibitor 4,4'diisothiocyanato-2,2'disulfonic stilbene was used to clamp intracellular pH and Cl or NO3 concentrations. Cell volume was maintained constant as external and internal pH differed by more than two units. K-Cl cotransport was calculated from the K effluxes and Rb (as K congener) influxes measured in Cl and NO3, at constant internal K and external anions, and variable concentrations of extracellular Rb and internal anions, respectively. The external Rb concentration at which net K-Cl cotransport is zero was defined as flux reversal point which changed with internal pH and hence Cl. Plots of the ratio of external Rb concentrations corresponding to the flux reversal points and the internal K concentration versus the ratio of the internal and external Cl concentrations (i.e., the Donnan ratio of the transported ions) yielded slopes near unity for both control and low internal Mg cells. Thus, basal as well as low internal Mg-stimulated net K-Cl cotransport depends on the electrochemical potential gradient of KCl.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes exhibit oscillations and waves of Ca2+ ions within their cytosol and it appears that this behavior helps facilitate the astrocyte's interaction with its environment, including its neighboring neurons. Often changes in the oscillatory behavior are initiated by an external stimulus such as glutamate, recently however, it has been observed that oscillations are also initiated spontaneously. We propose here a mathematical model of how spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations arise in astrocytes. This model uses the calcium-induced calcium release and inositol cross-coupling mechanisms coupled with a receptor-independent method for producing inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate as the heart of the model. By computationally mimicking experimental constraints we have found that this model provides results that are qualitatively similar to experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {The hippocampus of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is often hardened and shrunken, a condition known as sclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals an increase in the T2-weighted signal, while diffusion weighted imaging shows a higher apparent diffusion coefficient in sclerotic hippocampi, indicating increased water content. As water transport appears to be coupled to K+ clearance and neuronal excitability [4], the molecular basis of the perturbed water homeostasis in the sclerotic hippocampus was explored. The expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), the predominant water channel in the brain, was studied with quantitative real time PCR analysis, light microscopic immunohistochemistry and high-resolution immunogold labeling. A significant increase in AQP-4 was observed in sclerotic, but not in non-sclerotic, hippocampi obtained from patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. This increase was positively correlated with an increase in the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. AQP-4 was localized to the plasma membranes of astrocytes including the perivascular end-feet. Gene expression associated with increased AQP-4 was evaluated by high throughput gene expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip U133A and related gene networks were investigated with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. AQP-4 expression was associated with a decrease in expression of the dystrophin gene, a protein implicated in the anchoring of AQP-4 in perivascular endfeet. The decreased expression of dystrophin may indicate a loss of polarity in the distribution of AQP-4 in astrocytes. We conclude that the perturbed expression of AQP-4 and dystrophin may be one factor underlying the loss of ion and water homeostasis in the sclerotic hippocampus and hypothesize that the reported changes may contribute to the epileptogenic properties of the sclerotic tissue.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracellular [K+] can range within 2.5-3.5 mM under normal conditions to 50-80 mM under ischemic and spreading depression events. Sustained exposure to elevated [K+]o has been shown to cause significant neuronal death even under conditions of abundant glucose supply. Astrocytes are well equipped to buffer this initial insult of elevated [K] through extensive gap junctional coupling, Na+/K+ pump activity (with associated glycogen and glycolytic potential), and endfoot siphoning capability. Their abundant energy availability and alkalinizing mechanisms help sustain Na+/K+ ATPase activity under ischemic conditions. Furthermore, passive K+ uptake mechanisms and water flux mediated through aquaporin-4 channels in endfoot processes are important energy-independent mechanisms. Unfortunately, as the length of ischemic episode is prolonged, these mechanisms increase to a point where they begin to have repercussions on other important cellular functions. Alkalinizing mechanisms induce an elevation of [Na+]i, increasing the energy demand of Na+/K+ ATPase and leading to eventual detrimental reversal of the Na+/glutamate- cotransporter and excitotoxic damage. Prolonged ischemia also results in cell swelling and activates volume regulatory processes that release excessive excitatory amino acids, further exacerbating excitotoxic injury. In the days following ischemic injury, reactive astrocytes demonstrate increased cell size and process thickness, leading to improved spatial buffering capacity in regions outside the lesion core where there is better neuronal survival. There is a substantial heterogeneity among reactive astrocytes, with some close to the lesion showing decreased buffering capacity. However, it appears that both Na+/K+ ATPase activity (along with energy production processes) as well as passive K+ uptake mechanisms are upregulated in gliotic tissue outside the lesion to enhance the above-mentioned homeostatic mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Gray matter protoplasmic astrocytes extend very thin processes and establish close contacts with synapses. It has been suggested that the release of neuroactive gliotransmitters at the tripartite synapse contributes to information processing. However, the concept of calcium (Ca(2+))-dependent gliotransmitter release from astrocytes, and the release mechanisms are being debated. Studying astrocytes in their natural environment is challenging because: (i) astrocytes are electrically silent; (ii) astrocytes and neurons express an overlapping repertoire of transmembrane receptors; (iii) the size of astrocyte processes in contact with synapses are below the resolution of confocal and two-photon microscopes (iv) bulk-loading techniques using fluorescent Ca(2+) indicators lack cellular specificity. In this review, we will discuss some limitations of conventional methodologies and highlight the interest of novel tools and approaches for studying gliotransmission. Genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators (GECIs), light-gated channels, and exogenous receptors are being developed to selectively read out and stimulate astrocyte activity. Our review discusses emerging perspectives on: (i) the complexity of astrocyte Ca(2+) signaling revealed by GECIs; (ii) new pharmacogenetic and optogenetic approaches to activate specific Ca(2+) signaling pathways in astrocytes; (iii) classical and new techniques to monitor vesicle fusion in cultured astrocytes; (iv) possible strategies to express specifically reporter genes in astrocytes.},

  Abstract                 = {Activity of Na+-K+-2Cl- co-transport (NKCC1) in epithelia is thought to be highly regulated through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the transporter. Previous functional studies from this laboratory suggested a role for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a serine/threonine protein phosphatase involved in the regulation of mammalian tracheal epithelial NKCC1. We expand on these studies to characterize serine/threonine protein phosphatase(s) necessary for regulation of NKCC1 function and the interaction of the phosphatase(s) with proteins associated with NKCC1. NKCC1 activity was measured as bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb uptake or basolateral to apical 86Rb flux in primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells or in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells grown on Transwell filter inserts. Preincubation with 0.1 nm okadaic acid, a PP2A > phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor, increased NKCC1 activity 3.5-fold in human tracheal epithelial cells and 4.1-fold in Calu-3 cells. Calyculin, a PP1 > PP2A inhibitor, did not alter NKCC1 activity or percent bumetanide-sensitive flux. The effect of OA was dose-dependent with an IC50 of 0.4 nm. The alpha1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine increased NKCC1 activity and transiently increased PP2A activity 3.8-fold but did not alter PP1 activity. OA augmented methoxamine-dependent stimulation of NKCC1 activity. PP1, PP2A, and PP2C but not PP2B were detected in lysates from Calu-3 cells by immunoblot analysis. PP1 was not detected in immunoprecipitates of NKCC1 and vice versa. PP2A co-immunoprecipitated with NKCC1 and protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta) and was pulled down by a recombinant N terminus of NKCC1 consisting of amino acids 1-286. One novel finding is co-precipitation of STE20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase, a regulatory kinase for NKCC1, with PP2A and PKC-delta. The results suggest a model of actin serving as a scaffold for binding and association of PKC-delta, PP2A, and STE20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase. The role of the complex of serine/threonine protein kinases and a protein phosphatase is probably the maintenance of optimal phosphorylation of NKCC1 coincident with its physiological function in epithelial absorption and secretion.},

We show that this mechanism contributes to a noticeable part of the external current intensity, related inner electrical field and pH gradient, in agreement with experimental measurements.

  Abstract                 = {A receptive field constitutes a region in the visual field where a visual cell or a visual operator responds to visual stimuli. This paper presents a theory for what types of receptive field profiles can be regarded as natural for an idealized vision system, given a set of structural requirements on the first stages of visual processing that reflect symmetry properties of the surrounding world. These symmetry properties include (i) covariance properties under scale changes, affine image deformations, and Galilean transformations of space-time as occur for real-world image data as well as specific requirements of (ii) temporal causality implying that the future cannot be accessed and (iii) a time-recursive updating mechanism of a limited temporal buffer of the past as is necessary for a genuine real-time system. Fundamental structural requirements are also imposed to ensure (iv) mutual consistency and a proper handling of internal representations at different spatial and temporal scales. It is shown how a set of families of idealized receptive field profiles can be derived by necessity regarding spatial, spatio-chromatic, and spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of Gaussian kernels, Gaussian derivatives, or closely related operators. Such image filters have been successfully used as a basis for expressing a large number of visual operations in computer vision, regarding feature detection, feature classification, motion estimation, object recognition, spatio-temporal recognition, and shape estimation. Hence, the associated so-called scale-space theory constitutes a both theoretically well-founded and general framework for expressing visual operations. There are very close similarities between receptive field profiles predicted from this scale-space theory and receptive field profiles found by cell recordings in biological vision. Among the family of receptive field profiles derived by necessity from the assumptions, idealized models with very good qualitative agreement are obtained for (i) spatial on-center/off-surround and off-center/on-surround receptive fields in the fovea and the LGN, (ii) simple cells with spatial directional preference in V1, (iii) spatio-chromatic double-opponent neurons in V1, (iv) space-time separable spatio-temporal receptive fields in the LGN and V1, and (v) non-separable space-time tilted receptive fields in V1, all within the same unified theory. In addition, the paper presents a more general framework for relating and interpreting these receptive fields conceptually and possibly predicting new receptive field profiles as well as for pre-wiring covariance under scaling, affine, and Galilean transformations into the representations of visual stimuli. This paper describes the basic structure of the necessity results concerning receptive field profiles regarding the mathematical foundation of the theory and outlines how the proposed theory could be used in further studies and modelling of biological vision. It is also shown how receptive field responses can be interpreted physically, as the superposition of relative variations of surface structure and illumination variations, given a logarithmic brightness scale, and how receptive field measurements will be invariant under multiplicative illumination variations and exposure control mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Exogenous kainate receptor agonists have been shown to modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, but the pathways involved in physiological activation of the receptors remain largely unknown. Accumulating evidence indicates that astrocytes can release glutamate in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and signal to neighboring neurons. We tested the hypothesis that astrocyte-derived glutamate activates kainate receptors on hippocampal interneurons. We report here that elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) in astrocytes, induced by uncaging Ca(2+), o-nitrophenyl-EGTA, increased action potential-driven spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in nearby interneurons in rat hippocampal slices. This effect was blocked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptor antagonists, but not by selective AMPA receptor or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. This pharmacological profile indicates that kainate receptors were activated during Ca(2+) elevation in astrocytes. Kainate receptors containing the GluR5 subunit seemed to mediate the observed effect because a selective GluR5-containing kainate receptor antagonist blocked the changes in sIPSCs induced by Ca(2+) uncaging, and bath application of a selective GluR5-containing receptor agonist robustly potentiated sIPSCs. When tetrodotoxin was included to block action potentials, Ca(2+) uncaging induced a small decrease in the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which was not affected by AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists. Our data suggest that an astrocyte-derived, nonsynaptic source of glutamate represents a signaling pathway that can activate neuronal kainate receptors. By modulating the activity of interneurons, astrocytes may play a critical role in circuit function of hippocampus.},

CellML has evolved to meet these needs of the modelling community. CellML is a free, open-source, eXtensible markup language based standard for defining mathematical models of cellular function.

  Abstract                 = {Glutamate uptake is coupled to counter-transport of K+, and high external K+ concentrations can induce reversal of glutamate uptake in whole-cell patch-clamp and isolated membrane preparations. However, high external K+ causes little or no reversal of glutamate uptake in intact astrocytes, suggesting a regulatory mechanism not evident in membrane preparations. One mechanism by which intact cells could limit the effects of altered extracellular ion concentrations on glutamate transport is by compensatory changes in intracellular Na+ concentrations. This possibility was examined using astrocyte cultures treated in two ways to reduce the driving force for glutamate uptake: incubation in high K+ (with reciprocal reduction in Na+), and incubation with metabolic inhibitors to induce ATP depletion. ATP depletion produced a rise in intracellular Na+, a collapse of the membrane sodium gradient and a massive reversal of glutamate uptake. By contrast, incubation in high K+/low Na+ medium did not significantly alter the sodium gradient and did not induce glutamate uptake reversal. The sodium gradient was shown to be maintained under these conditions by compensatory reductions in intracellular Na+ that approximately matched the reductions in extracellular Na+. These findings suggest a mechanism by which astrocytes may limit reversal of glutamate uptake under high K+/low Na+ conditions, and further suggest a general mechanism by which Na(+)-dependent transport processes could be shielded from fluctuating extracellular ion concentrations.},

A prime example is the small intestine, where 10 liters of water are absorbed each day. Although water absorption is secondary to active solute transport, the coupling mechanism between solute and water flow is not understood. We have tested the hypothesis that water transport is directly linked to solute transport by cotransport proteins such as the brush border Na+/glucose cotransporter. The Na+/glucose cotransporter was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the changes in cell volume were measured under sugar-transporting and nontransporting conditions. We demonstrate that 260 water molecules are directly coupled to each sugar molecule transported and estimate that in the human intestine this accounts for 5 liters of water absorption per day. Other animal and plant cotransporters such as the Na+/CI-/gamma-aminobutyric acid, Na+/iodide and H+/amino acid transporters are also able to transport water and this suggests that cotransporters play an important role in water homeostasis.},

At smaller channel clusters, however, the three-dimensional electrodiffusion predictions diverge from the cable model predictions and show a broadening of the action potential, indicating a significant effect due to each channel's own local electric field. The node of Ranvier complex is an elaborate organization of membrane-bound aqueous compartments, and the model presented here represents what we believe is a significant first step in simulating electrophysiological events with combined realistic structural and physiological data.},

  Abstract                 = {A computational framework is presented for the continuum modeling of cellular biomolecular diffusion influenced by electrostatic driving forces. This framework is developed from a combination of state-of-the-art numerical methods, geometric meshing, and computer visualization tools. In particular, a hybrid of (adaptive) finite element and boundary element methods is adopted to solve the Smoluchowski equation (SE), the Poisson equation (PE), and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation (PNPE) in order to describe electrodiffusion processes. The finite element method is used because of its flexibility in modeling irregular geometries and complex boundary conditions. The boundary element method is used due to the convenience of treating the singularities in the source charge distribution and its accurate solution to electrostatic problems on molecular boundaries. Nonsteady-state diffusion can be studied using this framework, with the electric field computed using the densities of charged small molecules and mobile ions in the solvent. A solution for mesh generation for biomolecular systems is supplied, which is an essential component for the finite element and boundary element computations. The uncoupled Smoluchowski equation and Poisson-Boltzmann equation are considered as special cases of the PNPE in the numerical algorithm, and therefore can be solved in this framework as well. Two types of computations are reported in the results: stationary PNPE and time-dependent SE or Nernst-Planck equations solutions. A biological application of the first type is the ionic density distribution around a fragment of DNA determined by the equilibrium PNPE. The stationary PNPE with nonzero flux is also studied for a simple model system, and leads to an observation that the interference on electrostatic field of the substrate charges strongly affects the reaction rate coefficient. The second is a time-dependent diffusion process: the consumption of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase, determined by the SE and a single uncoupled solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The electrostatic effects, counterion compensation, spatiotemporal distribution, and diffusion-controlled reaction kinetics are analyzed and different methods are compared.},

Contusion volume was verified by 2,3,5,-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate staining. NKCC1 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR and the protein expression of NKCC1 was measured by Western blot. We found that the expression of NKCC1 RNA and protein were up-regulated in choroid plexus apical membrane from 2 h after traumatic brain injury, peaked at 8 h, and lasted for 24 h. Rats in the experimental group displayed severe brain edema (water content: 81.45 +/- 0.32\% compared with 78.38 +/- 0.62\% of sham group) and contusion volume significantly increased 8 h after traumatic brain injury (864.14 +/- 28.07 mm3). Administration of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (15 mg/kg, I.V.) significantly attenuated the contusion volume (464.03 +/- 23.62 mm3) and brain edema (water content: 79.12 +/- 0.28\%) after traumatic brain injury. Our study demonstrates that NKCC1 contributes to traumatic brain injury-induced brain edema and neuronal damage.},

  Abstract                 = {In the duck red blood cell, Na-K-2Cl cotransport exhibits two modes of ion movement: net cotransport and obligate cation exchange. In high-K cells, the predominant exchange is K/K (or K/Rb). In high-Na cells, it becomes Na/Na (or Na/Li). Both represent partial reactions in which a fully loaded carrier releases part of its cargo, rebinds fresh ions, and returns back across the membrane fully loaded. Net cotransport occurs when the carrier unloads completely and returns empty. This mode has a fixed stoichiometry of 1Na:1K:2Cl under all conditions tested. The ion requirements of the two exchanges differ: K/K exchange requires only K and Cl outside but all three ions inside. Na/Na exchange requires all three ions outside but only Na inside. We propose a simple model in which the carrier can only move when either fully loaded or completely empty and in which the ions bind in a strictly ordered sequence. For example, externally, a Na binds first and then a Cl, followed by a K and a second Cl. Internally, the first on is the first off (glide symmetry), so the Na is released first and then the first Cl, followed by the K and finally by the second Cl. Only then can the empty form return to the outside to start a new cycle.},

By using both manual tracing and an atlas-based semi-automatic segmentation approach, T2-weighted magnetic resonance microscopy images of 10 adult male formalin-fixed, excised C57BL/6J mouse brains were segmented into 20 anatomical structures. These structures included the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulbs, basal forebrain and septum, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray, superior colliculi, inferior colliculi, the rest of midbrain, cerebellum, brainstem, corpus callosum/external capsule, internal capsule, anterior commissure, fimbria, and ventricles. The segmentation data were formatted and stored into a database containing three different atlas types: 10 single-specimen brain atlases, an average brain atlas and a probabilistic atlas. Additionally, quantitative group information, such as variations in structural volume, surface area, magnetic resonance microscopy image intensity and local geometry, were computed and stored as an integral part of the database. The database augments ongoing efforts with other high priority strains as defined by the Mouse Phenome Database focused on providing a quantitative framework for accurate mapping of functional, genetic and protein expression patterns acquired by a myriad of technologies and imaging modalities.},

  Abstract                 = {It is generally accepted that cotransporters transport water in addition to their normal substrates, although the precise mechanism is debated; both active and passive modes of transport have been suggested. The magnitude of the water flux mediated by cotransporters may well be significant: both the number of cotransporters per cell and the unit water permeability are high. For example, the Na(+)-glutamate cotransporter (EAAT1) has a unit water permeability one tenth of that of aquaporin (AQP) 1. Cotransporters are widely distributed in the brain and participate in several vital functions: inorganic ions are transported by K(+)-Cl(-) and Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporters, neurotransmitters are reabsorbed from the synaptic cleft by Na(+)-dependent cotransporters located on glial cells and neurons, and metabolites such as lactate are removed from the extracellular space by means of H(+)-lactate cotransporters. We have previously determined water transport capacities for these cotransporters in model systems (Xenopus oocytes, cell cultures, and in vitro preparations), and will discuss their role in water homeostasis of the astroglial cell under both normo- and pathophysiologal situations. Astroglia is a polarized cell with EAAT localized at the end facing the neuropil while the end abutting the circulation is rich in AQP4. The water transport properties of EAAT suggest a new model for volume homeostasis of the extracellular space during neural activity.},

  Abstract                 = {An important feature of neuronal signalling is the increased concentration of K(+) in the extracellular space. The K(+) concentration is restored to its original basal level primarily by uptake into nearby glial cells. The molecular mechanisms by which K(+) is transferred from the extracellular space into the glial cell are debated. Although spatial buffer currents may occur, their quantitative contribution to K(+) clearance is uncertain. The concept of spatial buffering of K(+) precludes intracellular K(+) accumulation and is therefore (i) difficult to reconcile with the K(+) accumulation repeatedly observed in glial cells during K(+) clearance and (ii) incompatible with K(+)-dependent glial cell swelling. K(+) uptake into non-voltage clamped cultured glial cells is carried out by the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter in combination. In brain slices and intact optic nerve, however, only the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase has been demonstrated to be involved in stimulus-evoked K(+) clearance. The glial cell swelling associated with K(+) clearance is prevented under conditions that block the activity of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter. The Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter is activated by increased K(+) concentration and cotransports water along with its substrates. It thereby serves as a K(+)-dependent molecular water pump under conditions of increased extracellular K(+) load.},

Using the Cl--sensitive dye MQAE, we showed that the mock-infected MRC-5 cells express a functional NKCC. 1) Intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) was significantly reduced from 53.4 +/- 3.4 mM to 35.1 +/- 3.6 mM following bumetanide treatment. 2) Net Cl- efflux caused by replacement of external Cl- with gluconate was bumetanide sensitive. 3) In Cl--depleted mock-infected cells, the Cl- reuptake rate (in HCO-3-free media) was reduced in the absence of external Na+ and by treatment with bumetanide. After HCMV infection, we found that although [Cl-]i increased progressively [24 h postexposure (PE), 65.2 +/- 4.5 mM; 72 h PE, 80.4 +/- 5.0 mM], the bumetanide and Na+ sensitivities of [Cl-]i and net Cl- uptake and loss were reduced by 24 h PE and abolished by 72 h PE. Western blots using the NKCC-specific monoclonal antibody T4 showed an approximately ninefold decrease in the amount of NKCC protein after 72 h of infection. Thus HCMV infection resulted in the abolition of NKCC function coincident with the severe reduction in the amount of NKCC protein expressed.},

  Abstract                 = {Rundown of ionic gradients is a central feature of white matter anoxic injury; however, little is known about the contribution of anions such as Cl-. We used the in vitro rat optic nerve to study the role of aberrant Cl- transport in anoxia/ischemia. After 30 min of anoxia (NaN3, 2 mm), axonal membrane potential (V(m)) decreased to 42 +/- 11\% of control and to 73 +/- 11\% in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 microm). TTX + 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid disodium salt (500 microm), a broad spectrum anion transport blocker, abolished anoxic depolarization (95 +/- 8\%). Inhibition of the K-Cl cotransporter (KCC) (furosemide 100 microm) together with TTX was also more effective than TTX alone (84 +/- 14\%). The compound action potential (CAP) area recovered to 26 +/- 6\% of control after 1 hr anoxia. KCC blockade (10 microm furosemide) improved outcome (40 +/- 4\%), and TTX (100 nm) was even more effective (74 +/- 12\%). In contrast, the Cl- channel blocker niflumic acid (50 microm) worsened injury (6 +/- 1\%). Coapplication of TTX (100 nm) + furosemide (10 microm) was more effective than either agent alone (91 +/- 9\%). Furosemide was also very effective at normalizing the shape of the CAPs. The KCC3a isoform was localized to astrocytes. KCC3 and weaker KCC3a was detected in myelin of larger axons. KCC2 was seen in oligodendrocytes and within axon cylinders. Cl- gradients contribute to resting optic nerve membrane potential, and transporter and channel-mediated Cl- fluxes during anoxia contribute to injury, possibly because of cellular volume changes and disruption of axo-glial integrity, leading to propagation failure and distortion of fiber conduction velocities.},

  Abstract                 = {Primary and/or secondary glial cell death can cause and/or aggravate human diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Like neurons, glial cells are vulnerable to glutamate insults. Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes express a wide variety of glutamate receptors and transporters that mediate many of the deleterious effects of glutamate. Astrocytes are responsible for most glutamate uptake in synaptic and nonsynaptic areas and consequently, are the major regulators of glutamate homeostasis. Microglia in turn may secrete cytokines, which can impair glutamate uptake and reduce the expression of glutamate transporters. Finally, oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, are very sensitive to excessive glutamate signaling, which can lead to the apoptosis or necrosis of these cells. This review aims at summarizing the mechanisms leading to glial cell death as a consequence of alterations in glutamate signaling, and their clinical relevance. A thorough understanding of these events will undoubtedly lead to better therapeutic strategies to treat CNS diseases affecting glia and in particular, those that involve damage to white matter tracts.},

These include the basis for subtype-specific agonist selectivity; mechanisms for desensitization and allosteric modulation; and mechanisms for partial agonist activity. In addition, multiple lines of evidence, including low-resolution electron microscopic studies, suggest that native AMPA receptors combine with an auxiliary subunit which regulates activity and trafficking. Functional studies suggest that glutamate receptor gating is distinct from that of structurally related voltage-gated ion channels.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective. A common approach in modelling extracellular electrical stimulation is to represent neural tissue by a volume conductor when calculating the activating function as the driving term in a cable equation for the membrane potential. This approach ignores the cellular composition of tissue, including the neurites and their combined effect on the extracellular potential. This has a number of undesirable consequences. First, the two natural and equally valid choices of boundary conditions for the cable equation (i.e. using either voltage or current) lead to two mutually inconsistent predictions of the membrane potential. Second, the spatio-temporal distribution of the extracellular potential can be strongly affected by the combined cellular composition of the tissue. In this paper, we develop a mean field volume conductor theory to overcome these shortcomings of available models. Approach. This method connects the microscopic properties of the constituent fibres to the macroscopic electrical properties of the tissue by introducing an admittivity kernel for the neural tissue that is non-local, non-instantaneous and anisotropic. This generalizes the usual tissue conductivity. A class of bidomain models that is mathematically equivalent to this class of self-consistent volume conductor models is also presented. The bidomain models are computationally convenient for simulating the activation map of neural tissue using numerical methods such as finite element analysis. Main results. The theory is first developed for tissue composed of identical, parallel fibres and then extended to general neural tissues composed of mixtures of neurites with different and arbitrary orientations, arrangements and properties. Equations describing the extracellular and membrane potential for the longitudinal and transverse modes of stimulation are derived. Significance. The theory complements our earlier work, which developed extensions to cable theory for the micro-scale equations of neural stimulation that apply to individual fibres. The modelling framework provides a number of advantages over other approaches currently adopted in the literature and, therefore, can be used to accurately estimate the membrane potential generated by extracellular electrical stimulation.},

To study this possibility, we first examined the effect of neuronal activity on the appearance of vacuoles in mice lacking both Cx32 and Cx47. The size and number of myelin vacuoles was dramatically increased when axonal activity was increased, by either a natural stimulus (eye opening) or pharmacological treatment. Conversely, myelin vacuoles were dramatically reduced when axonal activity was suppressed. Second, we used genetic complementation to test for a relationship between the function of Kir4.1 and oligodendrocyte connexins. In a Cx32-null background, haploinsufficiency of either Cx47 or Kir4.1 did not affect myelin, but double heterozygotes developed vacuoles, consistent with the idea that oligodendrocyte connexins and Kir4.1 function in a common pathway. Together, these results implicate oligodendrocytes and their connexins as having critical roles in the buffering of K+ released during neuronal activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Glial cells have traditionally been considered to play supportive roles in the central nervous system. As recent experimental evidence suggests glial cells' participation in neural information processing, there has been a need to monitor the physiology of glial cells in vivo in the matured brain. Concurrently, identification and classification of the recorded glial cells is essential as there are at least several different kinds of glial cells. Past studies have achieved in vivo intracellular electrophysiological recording of glial cells using sharp glass microelectrodes, however, morphological recovery and identification of the recorded cells have hardly been done, due to technical difficulties. We demonstrate that use of large fragment biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) is an effective way to label a single glial cell recorded with a sharp microelectrode in vivo. Furthermore, the tracer signal amplification was achieved by a combination of avidin biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex (ABC) and tyramide-based methods, making multiple immunohistochemistry feasible. Using the method described in this study, we have successfully recorded and labeled cortical glial cells including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia.},

  Abstract                 = {Structural changes in hippocampal dendrites and dendritic spines are thought to be a consequence of a wide range of experience- and activity-dependent manipulations. We explored the dynamics of hippocampal dendritic spines in vivo by developing a surgical preparation of the adult mouse brain that enabled two-photon imaging of fluorescently labeled CA1 pyramidal neurons. Dendritic trees and spines were repeatedly visualized over many hours in exquisite detail. We tested spine stability under both control conditions and during prolonged epileptic seizures. Remarkably, spines remained structurally stable after 30 min of experimental induction of epileptic seizures. Spines began to disappear only several hours after induction of epileptic activity. We thus demonstrate that this technique provides a methodology for direct in vivo optical studies of the intact mammalian hippocampus.},

We also identify a mode of cardiac action potential propagation in which the ephaptic and gap-junction-mediated mechanisms alternate.

  Abstract                 = {The WNK1 and WNK4 genes have been found to be mutated in some patients with hyperkalemia and hypertension caused by pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. The clue to the pathophysiology of pseudohypoaldosteronism type II was its striking therapeutic response to thiazide diuretics, which are known to block the sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC). Although this suggests a role for WNK1 in hypertension, the precise molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we have shown that WNK1 phosphorylates and regulates the STE20-related kinases, Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress response 1 (OSR1). WNK1 was observed to phosphorylate the evolutionary conserved serine residue located outside the kinase domains of SPAK and OSR1, and mutation of the OSR1 serine residue caused enhanced OSR1 kinase activity. In addition, hypotonic stress was shown to activate SPAK and OSR1 and induce phosphorylation of the conserved OSR1 serine residue, suggesting that WNK1 may be an activator of the SPAK and OSR1 kinases. Moreover, SPAK and OSR1 were found to directly phosphorylate the N-terminal regulatory regions of cation-chloride-coupled cotransporters including NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC. Phosphorylation of NCC was induced by hypotonic stress in cells. These results suggested that WNK1 and SPAK/OSR1 mediate the hypotonic stress signaling pathway to the transporters and may provide insights into the mechanisms by which WNK1 regulates ion balance.},

  Abstract                 = {Microglia are equipped with a strong proton (H(+)) extrusion pathway, a voltage-gated H(+) channel, probably to compensate for the large amount of H(+) generated during phagocytosis; however, little is known about how this channel is regulated in pathological states. Because neural damage is often associated with intracellular and extracellular acidosis, we examined the regulatory mechanisms of the H(+) current of rat spinal microglia in acidic environments. More than 90\% of round/amoeboid microglia expressed the H(+) current, which was characterized by slow activation kinetics, dependencies on both intracellular and extracellular pH, and blockage by Zn(2+). Extracellular lactoacidosis, pH 6.8, induced intracellular acidification and cell swelling. Cell swelling was also induced by intracellular dialysis with acidic pipette solutions, pH 5.5-6.8, at normal extracellular pH 7.3 in the presence of Na(+). The H(+) currents were increased in association with cell swelling as shown by shifts of the half-activation voltage to more negative potentials and by acceleration of the activation kinetics. The acidosis-induced cell swelling and the accompanying potentiation of the H(+) current required nonhydrolytic actions of intracellular ATP and were inhibited by agents affecting actin filaments (phalloidin and cytochalasin D). The H(+) current was also potentiated by swelling caused by hypotonic stress. These findings suggest that the H(+) channel of microglia can be potentiated via cell swelling induced by intracellular acidification. This potentiation might operate as a negative feedback mechanism to protect microglia from cytotoxic acidification and hence acidosis-induced swelling in pathological states of the CNS.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The membrane current associated with the cotransport of Na+ and HCO3- was investigated in neuropil glial cells in isolated ganglia of the leech Hirudo medicinalis L. using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. 2. The addition of 5\% CO2-24 mM HCO3- evoked an outward current, which slowly decayed, and which was dependent upon the presence of external Na+. Removal of CO2-HCO3- elicited a transient inward current. Re-addition of Na+ to Na(+)-free saline in the presence of CO2-HCO3- also produced an outward current. Under these conditions an intracellular alkalinization and a rise in intracellular [Na+] were recorded using triple-barrelled, ion-sensitive microelectrodes. Addition or removal of HCO3-, in the absence of external Na+, caused little or no change in membrane voltage, membrane current and intracellular pH, indicating that the glial membrane has a very low HCO3- conductance. 3. Voltage steps revealed nearly linear current-voltage relationships both in the absence and presence of CO2-HCO3-, with an intersection at the assumed reversal potential of the HCO(3-)-dependent current. These results suggest a cotransport stoichiometry of 2HCO3-: 1 Na+. The HCO(3-)-dependent current could be inhibited by diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS). 4. Simultaneous recording of current and intracellular pH showed a correlation of the maximal acid-base flux with the transient HCO(3-)-dependent current during voltage steps in the presence of CO2-HCO3-. The maximum rate of acid-base flux and the HCO(3-)-dependent peak current showed a similar dependence on membrane voltage. Lowering the external pH from 7.4 to 7.0 produced an inward current, which increased twofold in the presence of CO2-HCO3-. This current was largely inhibited by DIDS, indicating outward-going electrogenic Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport during external acidification. 5. When external Na+ was replaced by Li+, a similar outward current and intracellular alkalinization were observed in the presence of CO2-HCO3-. The Li(+)-induced intracellular alkalinization was not inhibited by amiloride, a blocker of Na+(Li+)-H+ exchange, but was sensitive to DIDS. These results suggest that Li+ could, at least partly, substitute for Na+ at the cotransporter site. 6. Our results indicate that the Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport produces a current across the glial cell membrane in both directions with a reversal potential near the membrane resting potential, rendering pHi a function of the glial membrane potential.},

Enhanced transmission probability and frequency of the postsynaptic current-events are among the significant effects of the astrocyte on the synapse as experimentally characterized by several groups. In this paper we provide a mathematical framework for the relevant synaptic interactions between neurons and astrocytes that can account quantitatively for both the astrocytic effects on the synaptic transmission and the spontaneous postsynaptic events. Inferred from experiments, the model assumes that glutamate released by the astrocytes in response to synaptic activity regulates store-operated calcium in the presynaptic terminal. This source of calcium is distinct from voltage-gated calcium influx and accounts for the long timescale of facilitation at the synapse seen in correlation with calcium activity in the astrocytes. Our model predicts the inter-event interval distribution of spontaneous current activity mediated by a synaptic astrocyte and provides an additional insight into a novel mechanism for plasticity in which a low fidelity synapse gets transformed into a high fidelity synapse via astrocytic coupling.},

  Abstract                 = {Chemical synapses transmit information via the release of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles from the presynaptic terminal. Using computational modeling, we predict that the limited availability of neurotransmitter resources in combination with the spontaneous release of vesicles limits the maximum degree of enhancement of synaptic transmission. This gives rise to an optimal tuning that depends on the number of active zones. There is strong experimental evidence that astrocytes that enwrap synapses can modulate the probabilities of vesicle release through bidirectional signaling and hence regulate synaptic transmission. For low-fidelity hippocampal synapses, which typically have only one or two active zones, the predicted optimal values lie close to those determined by experimentally measured astrocytic feedback, suggesting that astrocytes optimize synaptic transmission of information.},

  Abstract                 = {The inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel Kir4.1 in brain astrocytes mediates spatial K(+) buffering and regulates neural activities. Recent studies have shown that loss-of-function mutations in the human gene KCNJ10 encoding Kir4.1 cause epileptic seizures, suggesting a close relationship between the Kir4.1 channel function and epileptogenesis. Here, we performed expressional analysis of Kir4.1 in a pilocarpine-induced rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to explore the role of Kir4.1 channels in modifying TLE epileptogenesis. Treatment of rats with pilocarpine (350 mg/kg, i.p.) induced acute status epilepticus, which subsequently caused spontaneous seizures 7-8 weeks after the pilocarpine treatment. Western blot analysis revealed that TLE rats (interictal condition) showed significantly higher levels of Kir4.1 than the control animals in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hypothalamus. However, the expression of other Kir subunits, Kir5.1 and Kir2.1, remained unaltered. Immunohistochemical analysis illustrated that Kir4.1-immunoreactivity-positive astrocytes in the pilocarpine-induced TLE model were markedly increased in most of the brain regions examined, concomitant with an increase in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes. In addition, Kir4.1 expression ratios relative to the number of astrocytes (Kir4.1-positive cells/GFAP-positive cells) were region-specifically elevated in the amygdala (i.e., medial and cortical amygdaloid nuclei) and sensory cortex. The present study demonstrated for the first time that the expression of astrocytic Kir4.1 channels was elevated in a pilocarpine-induced TLE model, especially in the amygdala, suggesting that astrocytic Kir4.1 channels play a role in modifying TLE epileptogenesis, possibly by acting as an inhibitory compensatory mechanism.},

In addition, Kir4. 1, but not AQP4, was concentrated in the basal approximately 300-400 nm of the M\"{u}ller cell microvilli. These data indicate that AQP4 may mediate the water flux known to be associated with K+ siphoning in the retina. By its highly differentiated distribution of AQP4, the M\"{u}ller cell may be able to direct the water flux to select extracellular compartments while protecting others (the subretinal space) from inappropriate volume changes. The identification of specialized membrane domains with high Kir4.1 expression provides a morphological correlate for the heterogeneous K+ conductance along the M\"{u}ller cell surface.},

In addition to an overview of the topic, discussion is focused on the organization of homologous gap junctional interactions between astrocytes and between oligodendrocytes as well as on heterologous junctional coupling between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The homotypic and heterotypic nature of these gap junctions is related to the connexins known to be produced by glial cells in the intact brain and spinal cord. Emphasis is placed on the ultrastructural level of analysis required to attribute gap junction and connexin deployment to particular cell types and subcellular locations. Our aim is to provide a firm basis for consideration of anticipated rapid advances in understanding of structural relationships of gap junctions and connexins within the glial gap junctional syncytium. Conclusions to date suggest that the glial syncytium is more complex than previously appreciated and that glial pathways of junctional communication may not only be determined by the presence of gap junctions, but also by the connexin composition and conductance regulation of junctional channels.},

Traditionally, a "neurocentric" view has dominated research in this field. Evidence is now accumulating that glial cells, in particular astrocytes, play an active and important role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Brain energetics, water and ion homeostasis, inflammation, trophic factor production, vascular regulation, neuroneogenesis, and vasculogenesis, among others, are all under the control of glial cells. As a consequence, glial cells have been identified as promising targets for novel therapeutic approaches in brain protection. This review aims at dissecting possible protective as well as destructive roles of astrocytes (and other glial cells) in cerebral ischemia. By emphasizing open issues in this field, we hope to stimulate further research into this relatively unexplored aspect of brain pathophysiology.},

However, work over the past decade has revealed that they interact with the vasculature to form a gliovascular network that might organize not only the structural architecture of the brain but also its communication pathways, activation, thresholds and plasticity. The net effect is that astroglia demarcate gray matter regions, both cortical and subcortical, into functional compartments whose internal activation thresholds and external outputs are regulated by single glial cells. The array of these astrocyte-delimited microdomains along the capillary microvasculature allows the formation of higher-order gliovascular units, which serve to match local neural activity and blood flow while regulating neuronal firing thresholds through coordinative glial signaling. By these means, astrocytes might establish the functional as well as the structural architecture of the adult brain.},

Recent advances in glial physiology have promoted an alternative hypothesis, which places information processing in the brain into integrated neuronal-glial networks utilizing both binary (neuronal action potentials) and analogue (diffusional propagation of second messengers/metabolites through gap junctions or transmitters through the interstitial space) signal encoding. It has been proposed that the feed-forward and feed-back communication between these two types of neural cells, which underlies information transfer and processing, is accomplished by the release of neurotransmitters from neuronal terminals as well as from astroglial processes. Understanding of this subject, however, remains incomplete and important questions and controversies require resolution. Here we propose that the primary function of perisynaptic glial processes is to create an "astroglial cradle" that shields the synapse from a multitude of extrasynaptic signaling events and provides for multifaceted support and long-term plasticity of synaptic contacts through variety of mechanisms, which may not necessarily involve the release of "glio" transmitters.},

  Abstract                 = {Sodium bicarbonate cotransport was studied in freshly dissociated M\"{u}ller cells of the salamander retina. Variations in intracellular and extracellular pH evoked extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o were recorded. Intracellular pH was measured by standard ratio imaging of the pH-sensitive dye BCECF, whereas extracellular pH was monitored by imaging BCECF fixed to coverslips under dissociated cells. Increasing [K+]o from 2.5 to 50 mM resulted in an intracellular alkalinization. The rate of alkalinization, 0.047 pH units/min, was reduced to 42\% of control when HEPES was substituted for HCO3- and was reduced to 36\% of control by the addition of 0.5 mM DIDS, a Na+/HCO3- cotransport blocker. The K(+)-evoked alkalinization was Cl(-)-independent and was not substantially reduced by amiloride or bumetanide. Increasing [K+]o to 50 mM also produced a rapid extracellular acidification, 0.01 to 0.05 pH units in amplitude. HEPES substitution and addition of 0.5 mM DIDS reduced the acidification to 7-8\% of control, respectively. These results confirm the presence of a Na+/HCO3- cotransport system in salamander M\"{u}ller cells and provide definitive evidence that glial cells can generate an extracellular acidification when [K+]o is increased. The K(+)-evoked extracellular acidification measured beneath cell endfeet was 304\% of the amplitude of the acidification beneath cell somata, confirming that cotransporter sites are preferentially localized to the endfoot. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor benzolamide (2 x 10(-5) M), which is poorly membrane permeant, increased the K(+)-evoked extracellular acidification to 269\% of control, demonstrating that salamander M\"{u}ller cells possess extracellular carbonic anhydrase.},

The rectification was similar in shape in both groups of cells but currents were 9.2 times larger in cells with endfeet. Ba2+ at 100 microM reduced the inward current to 6.8\% of control amplitude. Decreasing external K+ concentration shifted the cell current-voltage (I-V) relation in a hyperpolarizing direction and reduced current magnitude. In multichannel, cell-attached patch-clamp experiments, patches from both endfoot and soma membrane displayed strong inward rectification. Currents were 38 times larger in endfoot patches. In single-channel, cell-attached patch-clamp experiments, inward-rectifying K+ channels were, in almost all cases, the only channels present in patches of endfoot, proximal process, and soma membrane. Channel conductance was 27.8 pS in 98 mM external K+. Reducing external K+ shifted the channel reversal potential in a hyperpolarizing direction and reduced channel conductance. Channel open probability varied as a function of voltage, being reduced at more negative potentials. Together, these observations demonstrate that the principal ion channel in all M\"{u}ller cell regions is an inward-rectifying K+ channel. Channel density is far higher on the cell endfoot than in other cell regions. Whole-cell I-V plots of cells bathed in 12, 7, 4, and 2.5 mM K+ were fit by an equation including Boltzmann relation terms representing channel rectification and channel open probability. This equation was incorporated into a model of K+ dynamics in the retina to evaluate the significance of inward-rectifying channels to the spatial buffering/K+ siphoning mechanism of K+ regulation. Compared with ohmic channels, inward-rectifying channels increased the rate of K+ clearance from the retina by 23\% for a 1 mM K+ increase and by 137\% for a 9.5 mM K+ increase, demonstrating that M\"{u}ller cell inward-rectifying channels enhance K+ regulation in the retina.},

  Abstract                 = {M\"{u}ller cells are the principal glial cells of the retina, assuming many of the functions carried out by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells in other CNS regions. M\"{u}ller cells express numerous voltage-gated channels and neurotransmitter receptors, which recognize a variety of neuronal signals and trigger cell depolarization and intracellular Ca2+ waves. In turn, M\"{u}ller cells modulate neuronal activity by regulating the extracellular concentration of neuroactive substances, including: (1) K+, which is transported via M\"{u}ller-cell spatial-buffering currents; (2) glutamate and GABA, which are taken up by M\"{u}ller-cell high-affinity carriers; and (3) H+, which is controlled by the action of M\"{u}ller-cell Na(+)-HCO3- co-transport and carbonic anhydrase. The two-way communication between M\"{u}ller cells and retinal neurons indicates that M\"{u}ller cells play an active role in retinal function.},

Although the role of AQP4 in brain edema has been extensively investigated, little information exists regarding its functional role at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The purpose of this work is to integrate previous and recent data regarding AQP4 expression during BBB formation and depending on BBB integrity, using several experimental models. Results from studies on the chick optic tectum, a well-established model of BBB development, and the effect of lipopolysaccharide on the BBB integrity and on perivascular AQP4 expression have been analyzed and discussed. Moreover, data on the BBB structure and AQP4 expression in murine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are reviewed. In particular, published results obtained from mdx(3cv) mice have been analyzed together with new data obtained from mdx mice in which all the dystrophin isoforms including DP71 are strongly reduced. Finally, the role of the endothelial component on AQP4 cellular expression and distribution has been investigated using rat primary astrocytes and brain capillary endothelial cell co-cultures as an in vitro model of BBB.},

  Abstract                 = {The brain contains an intrinsic vasopressin fiber system the function of which is unknown. It has been demonstrated recently that astrocytes express high levels of a water channel, aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Because vasopressin is known to regulate aquaporin expression and translocation in kidney collecting ducts and thereby control water reabsorption, we hypothesized that vasopressin might serve a similar function in the brain. By recording intrinsic optical signals in an acute cortical slice preparation we showed that evoked neuronal activity generates a radial water flux in the neocortex. The rapid onset and high capacity of this flux suggest that it is mediated through the AQP4-containing astrocytic syncytium that spans the entire thickness of the neocortical mantle. Vasopressin and vasopressin receptor V1a agonists were found to facilitate this flux. V1a antagonists blocked the facilitatory effect of vasopressin and reduced the water flux even in the absence of any exogenous agonist. V2 agonists or antagonists had no effect. These data suggest that vasopressin and V1a receptors play a crucial role in the regulation of brain water and ion homeostasis, most probably by modulating aquaporin-mediated water flux through astrocyte plasma membranes.},

This current is involved in a variety of cellular functions, such as the maintenance of a constant cell volume, pH regulation, and control of membrane potential. It might also play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and in the processes that control transition from proliferation to differentiation. This review focuses on various aspects of this current, including its biophysical characterisation and its functional role for various cell processes. 2. Volume-activated Cl- channels show all outward rectification. Iodide is more permeable than chloride. In some cell types, ICl,vol inactivates at positive potentials. Single channel conductance can be divided mainly into two groups: small (< 5 pS) and medium conductance channels (around 50 pS). 3. The pharmacology and modulation of these channels are reviewed in detail, and suggest the existence of an heterogeneous family of multiple volume-activated Cl- channels. 4. Molecular candidates for this channel (i.e. ClC-2, a member of the ClC-family of voltage-dependent Cl- channels, the mdr-1 encoded P-glycoprotein, the nucleotide-sensitive pICln protein and phospholemman) will be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Firing-rate models describing neural-network activity can be formulated in terms of differential equations for the synaptic drive from neurons. Such models are typically derived from more general models based on Volterra integral equations assuming exponentially decaying temporal coupling kernels describing the coupling of pre- and postsynaptic activities. Here we study models with other choices of temporal coupling kernels. In particular, we investigate the stability properties of constant solutions of two-population Volterra models by studying the equilibrium solutions of the corresponding autonomous dynamical systems, derived using the linear chain trick, by means of the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. In the four investigated synaptic-drive models with identical equilibrium points we find that the choice of temporal coupling kernels significantly affects the equilibrium-point stability properties. A model with an alpha-function replacing the standard exponentially decaying function in the inhibitory coupling kernel is in most of our examples found to be most prone to instability, while the opposite situation with an alpha-function describing the excitatory kernel is found to be least prone to instability. The standard model with exponentially decaying coupling kernels is typically found to be an intermediate case. We further find that stability is promoted by increasing the weight of self-inhibition or shortening the time constant of the inhibition.},

In the CNS, ATP can be released from synaptic terminals, either on its own or together with other neurotransmitters. After the release from the presynaptic terminals, ATP binds to a plethora of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, which mediate its action as an excitatory neurotransmitter. Furthermore, ATP also acts as an important mediator in neuronal-glial communications because glial cells are endowed with numerous ATP receptors, which trigger Ca(2+) signaling events and membrane currents in both macro and microglia. In addition, ATP can be released from astroglial cells, thereby acting as a mediator of glial-glial and glial-neuronal signaling.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses mathematical approaches for modeling the propagation of the action potential and ion concentration dynamics in a general class of excitable cells and cell assemblies of concentric cylindrical geometry. Examples include myelinated and unmyelinated axons, single strands of interconnected cardiac cells and outer hair cells. A key feature in some of the cells is the presence of a small working volume such as the periaxonal space between the myelin sheath and the axon in the myelinated axon and the extracisternal space between the plasma membrane and the subsurface cisterna of the outer hair cell. Proper treatment of these cell types requires a modeling approach which can readily address these anatomical properties and the non-uniform biophysical properties of the concentric membranes and the ionic composition of the volumes between the membranes. An electrodiffusion approach is first developed in which the Nernst-Planck equation is used to characterize axial ion fluxes. It is then demonstrated that this "full" model can be stepwise reduced, eventually becoming equivalent to the standard cable equation formulation. This is done in a manner that permits direct comparisons between the full and simplified models by running simulations using a single parameter set. An intermediate approach where the contributions of the axial currents to ion concentration changes and the effect of varying ion concentrations on solution conductivities are ignored is derived and is found adequate in many cases. Two application examples are given: a "cardiac strand" model, for which the intermediate formulation is shown sufficient and a model of the myelinated axon, for which the full electrodiffusion formulation is clearly necessary. The latter finding is due to spatial inhomogeneities in the anatomy and distribution of ion channels and transporters in the myelinated axon and the restricted periaxonal space between the myelin sheath and the axon.},

  Abstract                 = {Ischemia-induced brain edema formation is mediated by increased transport of Na and Cl across an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). Our previous studies have provided evidence that a luminally located BBB Na-K-Cl cotransporter is stimulated during cerebral ischemia to increase transport of Na and Cl into the brain. The main focus of the present study was to evaluate the effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP), previously shown to be increased in the brain during ischemia and to promote edema formation, on activity of the BBB cotransporter. Cerebral microvascular endothelial cell (CMEC) monolayers were cultured in astroglial cell conditioned medium, and Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity was assessed as bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb influx. In both human and bovine CMECs, as well as in freshly isolated microvessels, AVP stimulated cotransport activity. This stimulatory effect was mimicked by V(1) but not V(2) vasopressin agonists and was blocked by V(1) but not V(2) vasopressin antagonists. Consistent with a V(1) vasopressin receptor mechanism of action, AVP caused an increase in CMEC intracellular [Ca] that was blocked by a V(1) antagonist. Exposing the cells to [Ca]-free media and/or reducing intracellular [Ca] by BAPTA also blocked AVP stimulation of CMEC cotransporter activity, as did the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122. Finally, we found that while stimulation of CMEC cotransporter activity by AVP occurred within minutes, it was also sustained for hours in the continued presence of AVP. These findings support the hypothesis that AVP, through a V(1) receptor- and [Ca]-dependent mechanism, stimulates the BBB Na-K-Cl cotransporter to participate in ischemia-induced edema formation.},

  Abstract                 = {Estrogen has been shown to protect against stroke-induced brain damage, yet the mechanism is unknown. During the early hours of stroke, cerebral edema forms as increased transport of Na and Cl from blood into brain occurs across an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). We showed previously that a luminal BBB Na-K-Cl cotransporter is stimulated by hypoxia and arginine vasopressin (AVP), factors present during cerebral ischemia, and that inhibition of the cotransporter by intravenous bumetanide greatly reduces edema in rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The present study was conducted to determine whether estrogen protects in stroke at least in part by reducing activity of the BBB cotransporter, thereby decreasing edema formation. Ovariectomized rats were subjected to 210 mins of permanent MCAO after 7-day or 30-min pretreatment with 17beta-estradiol and then brain swelling and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining were assessed as measures of brain edema and lesion volume, respectively. Diffusion-weighed imaging was used to monitor permanent MCAO-induced decreases in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, an index of changes in brain water distribution and mobility. Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) was assessed as bumetanide-sensitive K influx and cotransporter abundance by Western blot analysis after estradiol treatment. Estradiol significantly decreased brain swelling and lesion volume and attenuated the decrease in ADC values during permanent MCAO. Estradiol also abolished CMEC cotransporter stimulation by chemical hypoxia or AVP and decreased cotransporter abundance. These findings support the hypothesis that estrogen attenuates stimulation of BBB Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity, reducing edema formation during stroke.},

From generic assumptions about the molecular biology underlying channel expression, we derive a simple model and show how it encodes an "activity set point" in single neurons. The model generates diverse self-regulating cell types and relates correlations in conductance expression observed in vivo to underlying channel expression rates. Synaptic as well as intrinsic conductances can be regulated to make a self-assembling central pattern generator network; thus, network-level homeostasis can emerge from cell-autonomous regulation rules. Finally, we demonstrate that the outcome of homeostatic regulation depends on the complement of ion channels expressed in cells: in some cases, loss of specific ion channels can be compensated; in others, the homeostatic mechanism itself causes pathological loss of function.},

  Abstract                 = {Defining the microanatomic differences between the human brain and that of other mammals is key to understanding its unique computational power. Although much effort has been devoted to comparative studies of neurons, astrocytes have received far less attention. We report here that protoplasmic astrocytes in human neocortex are 2.6-fold larger in diameter and extend 10-fold more GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)-positive primary processes than their rodent counterparts. In cortical slices prepared from acutely resected surgical tissue, protoplasmic astrocytes propagate Ca(2+) waves with a speed of 36 microm/s, approximately fourfold faster than rodent. Human astrocytes also transiently increase cystosolic Ca(2+) in response to glutamatergic and purinergic receptor agonists. The human neocortex also harbors several anatomically defined subclasses of astrocytes not represented in rodents. These include a population of astrocytes that reside in layers 5-6 and extend long fibers characterized by regularly spaced varicosities. Another specialized type of astrocyte, the interlaminar astrocyte, abundantly populates the superficial cortical layers and extends long processes without varicosities to cortical layers 3 and 4. Human fibrous astrocytes resemble their rodent counterpart but are larger in diameter. Thus, human cortical astrocytes are both larger, and structurally both more complex and more diverse, than those of rodents. On this basis, we posit that this astrocytic complexity has permitted the increased functional competence of the adult human brain.},

Using diolistic labeling, we show that cortical astrocytes lost their nonoverlapping domain organization in three mouse models of epilepsy: posttraumatic injury, genetic susceptibility, and systemic kainate exposure. Neighboring astrocytes in epileptic mice showed a 10-fold increase in overlap of processes. Concurrently, spine density was increased on dendrites of excitatory neurons. Suppression of seizures by the common antiepileptic, valproate, reduced the overlap of astrocytic processes. Astrocytic domain organization was also preserved in APP transgenic mice expressing a mutant variant of human amyloid precursor protein despite a marked upregulation of GFAP. Our data suggest that loss of astrocytic domains was not universally associated with gliosis, but restricted to seizure pathologies. Reorganization of astrocytes may, in concert with dendritic sprouting and new synapse formation, form the structural basis for recurrent excitation in the epileptic brain.},

abstract = {We used whole-cell patch recording to study 102 local interneurons in the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro. Input impedance with this technique (607.0+/-222.4 MOhm) was far larger than that measured with sharp electrode techniques, suggesting that interneurons may be more electrotonically compact than previously believed. Consistent and robust burst firing was observed in all interneurons when a slight depolarizing boost was given from a potential at, or slightly hyperpolarized from, resting membrane potential. These bursts had some similarities to the low-threshold spike described previously in other thalamic neuron types. The bursting responses were blocked by Ni+, suggesting that the low-threshold calcium current I(T), responsible for the low-threshold spike, was also involved in interneuron burst firing. Compared to the low-threshold spike of thalamocortical cells, however, the interneuron bursts were of relatively long duration and low intraburst frequency. The requirement for a depolarizing boost to elicit the burst is consistent with previous reports of a depolarizing shift of the I(T) activation curve of interneurons relative to thalamocortical cells, a finding we confirmed using voltage-clamp. Voltage-clamp study also revealed an additional long-lasting current that could be tentatively identified as the calcium activated non-selective cation current, I(CAN), based on reversal potential and on pharmacological characteristics. Computer simulation of the interneuron burst demonstrated that its particular morphology is likely due to the interaction of I(T) and I(CAN). In the slice, bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of the optic tract, suggesting that they may occur in response to natural stimulation. Synaptically triggered bursts were only partially blocked by Ni+, but could then be completely blocked by further addition of (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. The existence of robust bursts in this cell type suggests an additional role for interneurons in sculpting sensory responses by feedforward inhibition of thalamocortical cells. The low-threshold spike is a mechanism whereby activity in a neuron is dependent on a prior lack of activity in that same neuron. Understanding of the low-threshold spike in the other major neuron types of the thalamus has brought many new insights into how thalamic oscillations might be involved in sleep and epilepsy. Our description of this phenomenon in the interneurons of the thalamus suggests that these network oscillations might be even more complicated than previously believed.},

Neurons swelled extensively 10 min after the addition of veratridine, and returned to their initial size within 2 h. Intracellular Na(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations and amino acid release from the cells, in particular, that of glutamate, increased after the treatment with veratridine. Approximately 70\% of neurons died within 24 h. T-477 inhibited both veratridine-induced swelling and death in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, T-477 concentration dependently reduced the increases in Na(+) and Ca(2+) influx and amino acid release. These results suggest that T-477 prevented the veratridine-induced influx of Na(+) and, thereby, reduced neuronal swelling. This, combined with the effects of T-477 on the inhibition of Ca(2+) influx and glutamate release, possibly by the blockade of Na(+) channels, may be the mechanism by which T-477 protects neurons from death induced by veratridine.},

  Abstract                 = {A central problem in modeling blood flow and pressure in the larger systemic arteries is determining a physiologically based boundary condition so that the arterial tree can be truncated after a few generations. We have used a structured tree attached to the terminal branches of the truncated arterial tree in which the root impedance is estimated using a semianalytical approach based on a linearization of the viscous axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. This provides a dynamic boundary condition that maintains the phase lag between blood flow and pressure as well as the high-frequency oscillations present in the impedance spectra. Furthermore, it accommodates the wave propagation effects for the entire systemic arterial tree. The result is a model that is physiologically adequate as well as computationally feasible. For validation, we have compared the structured tree model with a pure resistance and a windkessel model as well as with measured data.},

  Abstract                 = {The renal Na(+):Cl(-) cotransporter rNCC is mutated in human disease, is the therapeutic target of thiazide-type diuretics, and is clearly involved in arterial blood pressure regulation. rNCC belongs to an electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporter family (SLC12A) that has two major branches with inverse physiological functions and regulation: sodium-driven cotransporters (NCC and NKCC1/2) that mediate cellular Cl(-) influx are activated by phosphorylation, whereas potassium-driven cotransporters (KCCs) that mediate cellular Cl(-) efflux are activated by dephosphorylation. A cluster of three threonine residues at the amino-terminal domain has been implicated in the regulation of NKCC1/2 by intracellular chloride, cell volume, vasopressin, and WNK/STE-20 kinases. Nothing is known, however, about rNCC regulatory mechanisms. By using rNCC heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, here we show that two independent intracellular chloride-depleting strategies increased rNCC activity by 3-fold. The effect of both strategies was synergistic and dose-dependent. Confocal microscopy of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged rNCC showed no changes in rNCC cell surface expression, whereas immunoblot analysis, using the R5-anti-NKCC1-phosphoantibody, revealed increased phosphorylation of rNCC amino-terminal domain threonine residues Thr(53) and Thr(58). Elimination of these threonines together with serine residue Ser(71) completely prevented rNCC response to intracellular chloride depletion. We conclude that rNCC is activated by a mechanism that involves amino-terminal domain phosphorylation.},

Recent experiments have shown that hypotonic conditions stimulate the release of glutamate and ATP from astrocytes, but a mechanistic understanding of this process is not available. To determine whether hypotonicity activates the process of regulated exocytosis, we monitored membrane capacitance by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique whilst a hypotonic medium was applied to cultured astrocytes. If exocytosis is triggered under hypotonic conditions, as it is following increases in cytosolic calcium, a net increase in membrane surface area, monitored by measuring the whole-cell membrane capacitance, is expected. Simultaneous measurements of cell size and whole-cell membrane conductance and surface area demonstrated that hypotonic medium (210 mOsm for 200 s) resulted in an increase in membrane conductance and in the swelling of cultured astrocytes by an average of 40\%, as monitored by cell cross-sectional area, but without any corresponding change in membrane surface area. As we have demonstrated that capacitance measurements have the sensitivity to detect increases in cell surface area as small as 0.5\%, we conclude that cell swelling occurs via an exocytosis-independent mechanism, probably involving the unfolding of the plasma membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {The cellular mechanisms underlying glial cell swelling, a central cause of edema formation in the brain and retina, are not yet known. Here, we show that glial cells in the postischemic rat retina, but not in control retina, swell upon hypotonic stress. Swelling of control cells could be evoked when their K(+) channels were blocked. After transient ischemia, glial cells strongly downregulated their K(+) conductance and their prominent Kir4.1 protein expression at blood vessels and the vitreous body. In contrast, the expression of the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) (water channel) protein was only slightly altered after ischemia. Activation of D(2) dopaminergic receptors prevents the hypotonic glial cell swelling. The present results elucidate the coupling of transmembraneous water fluxes to K(+) currents in glial cells and reveal the role of altered K(+) channel expression in the development of cytotoxic edema. We propose a mechanism of postischemic glial cell swelling where a downregulation of their K(+) conductance prevents the emission of intracellularly accumulated K(+) ions, resulting in osmotically driven water fluxes from the blood into the glial cells via aquaporins. Inhibition of these water fluxes may be beneficial to prevent ischemia-evoked glial cell swelling.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite their diverse histological types, most brain tumours cause brain oedema, which is a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Brain tumour oedema occurs when plasma-like fluid enters the brain extracellular space through impaired capillary endothelial tight junctions in tumours. Under-expression of the tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-1 and claudin-5 are key molecular abnormalities responsible for the increased permeability of tumour endothelial tight junctions. Recent evidence suggests that the membrane water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) also plays a role in brain tumour oedema. AQP4-deficient mice show remarkably altered brain water balance after various insults, including brain tumour implantation. AQP4 expression is strongly upregulated around malignant human brain tumours in association with reduced extracellular volume, which may restrict the flow of extracellular fluid from the tumour bed into the brain parenchyma. Elimination of excess fluid leaking into brain parenchyma requires passage across three AQP4-rich barriers: a) the glia limitans externa, b) the glia limitans interna/ependyma, and c) the blood-brain barrier. Modulation of the expression and/or function of endothelial tight junction proteins and aquaporins may provide novel therapeutic options for reducing brain tumour oedema.},

This distribution suggests that AQP4 controls water fluxes into and out of the brain parenchyma. Experiments using AQP4-null mice provide strong evidence for AQP4 involvement in cerebral water balance. AQP4-null mice are protected from cellular (cytotoxic) brain edema produced by water intoxication, brain ischemia, or meningitis. However, AQP4 deletion aggravates vasogenic (fluid leak) brain edema produced by tumor, cortical freeze, intraparenchymal fluid infusion, or brain abscess. In cytotoxic edema, AQP4 deletion slows the rate of water entry into brain, whereas in vasogenic edema, AQP4 deletion reduces the rate of water outflow from brain parenchyma. AQP4 deletion also worsens obstructive hydrocephalus. Recently, AQP4 was also found to play a major role in processes unrelated to brain edema, including astrocyte migration and neuronal excitability. These findings suggest that modulation of AQP4 expression or function may be beneficial in several cerebral disorders, including hyponatremic brain edema, hydrocephalus, stroke, tumor, infection, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury.},

To investigate the role of AQP4 in meningitis-induced brain edema, Streptococcus pneumoniae was injected into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in wild type and AQP4 null mice. AQP4-deficient mice had remarkably lower intracranial pressure (9 +/- 1 versus 25 +/- 5 cm H2O) and brain water accumulation (2 +/- 1 versus 9 +/- 1 microl) at 30 h, and improved survival (80 versus 0\% survival) at 60 h, through comparable CSF bacterial and white cell counts. Meningitis produced marked astrocyte foot process swelling in wild type but not AQP4 null mice, and slowed diffusion of an inert macromolecule in brain extracellular space. AQP4 protein was strongly up-regulated in meningitis, resulting in a approximately 5-fold higher water permeability (P(f)) across the blood-brain barrier compared with non-infected wild type mice. Mathematical modeling using measured P(f) and CSF dynamics accurately simulated the elevated lower intracranial pressure and brain water produced by meningitis and predicted a beneficial effect of prevention of AQP4 upregulation. Our findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of brain edema in acute bacterial meningitis, and suggest that inhibition of AQP4 function or up-regulation may dramatically improve clinical outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {An increase of extracellular potassium ion concentration can result in neuronal hyperexcitability, and thus contribute to non-synaptic epileptiform activity. It has been shown that potassium lateral diffusion alone is sufficient for synchronization in the low-calcium epilepsy in-vitro model. However, it is not yet known whether the lateral diffusion can, by itself, induce seizure activity. We hypothesize that spontaneous sustained neuronal activity can be generated by potassium coupling between neurons. To test this hypothesis, neuronal simulations with 2-cell or 4-cell models were used. Each model neuron was embedded in a bath of K+ and surrounded by interstitial space. Interstitial potassium concentration was regulated by both K+-pump and glial buffer mechanisms. Simulations performed with two coupled neurons with parameter values within physiological range show that, without chemical and electrical synapses, potassium lateral diffusion alone can generate and synchronize zero-Ca2+ non-synaptic epileptiform activity. Simulations performed with a network of four zero-Ca2+ CA1 pyramidal neurons modeled in zero-calcium conditions also show that spontaneous sustained activity can propagate by potassium lateral diffusion alone with a velocity of approximately 0.93 mm/sec. This diffusion model used for the simulations is based on physiological parameters, is robust for various kinetics, and is able to reproduce both the spontaneous triplet bursting of non-synaptic activity and speed of propagation in low-Ca2+ non-synaptic epilepsy experiments. These simulations suggest that potassium lateral diffusion can play an important role in the synchronization and generation on non-synaptic epilepsy.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffusive coupling (nearest-neighbor coupling) is the most common type of coupling present in many systems. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown that potassium lateral diffusion coupling (i.e., diffusive coupling) can be responsible for synchronization of neuronal activity. Recent in vivo experiments carried out with anesthetized rat hippocampus suggested that the extracellular potassium could play an important role in the generation of a novel type of epileptiform nonsynaptic activity. Yet, the role of potassium in the generation of seizures remains controversial. We tested the hypothesis that potassium lateral diffusion coupling is responsible for the coupling mechanisms for network periodicity in a nonsynaptic model of epilepsy in vivo using a CA1 pyramidal neuron network model The simulation results show that 1), potassium lateral diffusion coupling is crucial for establishing epileptiform activity similar to that generated experimentally; and 2), there exists a scaling relation between the critical coupling strength and the number of cells in the network. The results not only agree with the theoretical prediction, but strongly suggest that potassium lateral diffusion coupling, a physiological realization of the concept of diffusive coupling, can play an important role in entraining periodicity in a nonsynaptic neural network.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study was to determine the relative contribution of Cl(-) channels to volume regulation of cultured rat cortical astrocytes after hypotonic cell swelling. Using a Coulter counter, we showed that cortical astrocytes regulate their cell volume by approximately 60\% within 45 min after hypotonic challenge. This volume regulation was supported when Cl(-) was replaced with Br(-), NO(3)(-), methanesulfonate(-), or acetate(-) but was inhibited when Cl(-) was replaced with isethionate(-) or gluconate(-). Additionally, substitution of Cl(-) with I(-) completely blocked volume regulation. Volume regulation was unaffected by furosemide or bumetanide, blockers of KCl transport, but was inhibited by Cl(-) channel blockers, including 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB), 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), and niflumic acid. Surprisingly, the combination of Cd(2+) with NPPB, DIDS, or niflumic acid inhibited regulation to a greater extent than any of these drugs alone. Volume regulation did not differ among astrocytes cultured from different brain regions, as cerebellar and hippocampal astrocytes exhibited behavior identical to that of cortical astrocytes. These data suggest that Cl(-) flux through ion channels rather than transporters is essential for volume regulation of cultured astrocytes in response to hypotonic challenge.},

Although both voltage- and ligand-gated channels are being extensively studied, the central role of ion pumps and carriers is largely ignored in current neuroscience. Such an information gap is particularly evident with regard to neuronal Cl- regulation, despite its immense importance in the generation of inhibitory synaptic responses by GABA- and glycine-gated anion channels. The cation-chloride co-transporters (CCCs) have been identified as important regulators of neuronal Cl- concentration, and recent work indicates that CCCs play a key role in shaping GABA- and glycine-mediated signaling, influencing not only fast cell-to-cell communication but also various aspects of neuronal development, plasticity and trauma.},

  Abstract                 = {Maintenance of a stable cell volume and intracellular pH is critical for normal cell function. Arguably, two of the most important ion transporters involved in these processes are the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) and Na+ -K+ -2Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1). Both NHE1 and NKCC1 are stimulated by cell shrinkage and by numerous other stimuli, including a wide range of hormones and growth factors, and for NHE1, intracellular acidification. Both transporters can be important regulators of cell volume, yet their activity also, directly or indirectly, affects the intracellular concentrations of Na+, Ca2+, Cl-, K+, and H+. Conversely, when either transporter responds to a stimulus other than cell shrinkage and when the driving force is directed to promote Na+ entry, one consequence may be cell swelling. Thus stimulation of NHE1 and/or NKCC1 by a deviation from homeostasis of a given parameter may regulate that parameter at the expense of compromising others, a coupling that may contribute to irreversible cell damage in a number of pathophysiological conditions. This review addresses the roles of NHE1 and NKCC1 in the cellular responses to physiological and pathophysiological stress. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and consequences of stress-induced stimulation of these transporters with focus on the heart, brain, and blood. The physiological stressors reviewed are metabolic/exercise stress, osmotic stress, and mechanical stress, conditions in which NHE1 and NKCC1 play important physiological roles. With respect to pathophysiology, the focus is on ischemia and severe hypoxia where the roles of NHE1 and NKCC1 have been widely studied yet remain controversial and incompletely elucidated.},

  Abstract                 = {Glutamate, released at a majority of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, depolarizes neurons by acting at specific receptors. Its action is terminated by removal from the synaptic cleft mostly via Na(+)-dependent uptake systems located on both neurons and astrocytes. Here we report that glutamate, in addition to its receptor-mediated actions on neuronal excitability, stimulates glycolysis--i.e., glucose utilization and lactate production--in astrocytes. This metabolic action is mediated by activation of a Na(+)-dependent uptake system and not by interaction with receptors. The mechanism involves the Na+/K(+)-ATPase, which is activated by an increase in the intracellular concentration of Na+ cotransported with glutamate by the electrogenic uptake system. Thus, when glutamate is released from active synapses and taken up by astrocytes, the newly identified signaling pathway described here would provide a simple and direct mechanism to tightly couple neuronal activity to glucose utilization. In addition, glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is consistent with data obtained from functional brain imaging studies indicating local nonoxidative glucose utilization during physiological activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes play active roles in brain physiology. They respond to neurotransmitters and modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic function. However, the influence of astrocytes on synaptic transmission and plasticity at the single synapse level is unknown. Ca(2+) elevation in astrocytes transiently increased the probability of transmitter release at hippocampal area CA3-CA1 synapses, without affecting the amplitude of synaptic events. This form of short-term plasticity was due to the release of glutamate from astrocytes, a process that depended on Ca(2+) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein and that activated metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The transient potentiation of transmitter release became persistent when the astrocytic signal was temporally coincident with postsynaptic depolarization. This persistent plasticity was mGluR-mediated but N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-independent. These results indicate that astrocytes are actively involved in the transfer and storage of synaptic information.},

Using electrophysiological and Ca2+ imaging techniques in rat hippocampal slices, we investigated the astrocytic Ca2+ signal modulation induced by synaptic terminals that use glutamate and acetylcholine. Ca2+ elevations were evoked by glutamate released from Schaffer collaterals and by acetylcholine, but not glutamate, released by alveus stimulation, indicating that astrocytes discriminate the activity of different synapses belonging to different axon pathways. The Ca2+ signal was modulated bidirectionally by simultaneous activation of both pathways, being depressed at high stimulation frequencies and enhanced at low frequencies. The Ca2+ modulation was attributable to astrocytic intrinsic properties, occurred at discrete regions of the processes, and controlled the intracellular expansion of the Ca2+ signal. In turn, astrocyte Ca2+ signal elicited NMDA receptor-mediated currents in pyramidal neurons. Therefore, because astrocytes discriminate and integrate synaptic information, we propose that they can be considered as cellular elements involved in the information processing by the nervous system.},

  Abstract                 = {Whenever a spatially inhomogeneous electrolyte, composed of ions with different mobilities, is allowed to diffuse, charge separation and an electric potential difference is created. Such potential differences across very thin membranes (e.g. biomembranes) are often interpreted using the steady state Goldman equation, which is usually derived by assuming a spatially constant electric field. Through the fundamental Poisson equation of electrostatics, this implies the absence of free charge density that must provide the source of any such field. A similarly paradoxical situation is encountered for thick membranes (e.g. in ion-selective electrodes) for which the diffusion potential is normally interpreted using the Henderson equation. Standard derivations of the Henderson equation appeal to local electroneutrality, which is also incompatible with sources of electric fields, as these require separated charges. We analyse self-consistent solutions of the Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations for a 1 : 1-univalent electrolyte to show that the Goldman and Henderson steady-state membrane potentials are artefacts of extraneous charges created in the reservoirs of electrolyte solution on either side of the membrane, due to the unphysical nature of the usual (Dirichlet) boundary conditions assumed to apply at the membrane-electrolyte interfaces. We also show, with the aid of numerical simulations, that a transient electric potential difference develops in any confined, but initially non-uniform, electrolyte solution. This potential difference ultimately decays to zero in the real steady state of the electrolyte, which corresponds to thermodynamic equilibrium. We explain the surprising fact that such transient potential differences are well described by the Henderson equation by using a computer algebra system to extend previous steady-state singular perturbation theories to the time-dependent case. Our work therefore accounts for the success of the Henderson equation in analysing experimental liquid-junction potentials.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for estimation of current-source density (CSD) from local field potentials is presented. This inverse CSD (iCSD) method is based on explicit inversion of the electrostatic forward solution and can be applied to data from multielectrode arrays with various geometries. Here, the method is applied to linear-array (laminar) electrode data. Three iCSD methods are considered: the CSD is assumed to have cylindrical symmetry and be (i) localized in infinitely thin discs, (ii) step-wise constant or (iii) continuous and smoothly varying (using cubic splines) in the vertical direction. For spatially confined CSD distributions the standard CSD method, involving a discrete double derivative, is seen in model calculations to give significant estimation errors when the lateral source dimension is comparable to the size of a cortical column (less than approximately 1 mm). Further, discontinuities in the extracellular conductivity are seen to potentially give sizable errors for even wider source distributions. The iCSD methods are seen to give excellent estimates when the correct lateral source dimension and spatial distribution of conductivity are incorporated. To illustrate the application to real data, iCSD estimates of stimulus-evoked responses measured with laminar electrodes in the rat somatosensory (barrel) cortex are compared to estimates from the standard CSD method.},

The main results are: 1), All models yield a low-pass filtering effect, that is, a spike-width increase with increasing distance from soma. 2), A neuron's extracellular spike amplitude is seen to be approximately proportional to the sum of the dendritic cross-sectional areas of all dendritic branches connected to the soma. Thus, neurons with many, thick dendrites connected to soma will produce large amplitude spikes, and therefore have the largest radius of visibility. 3), The spike shape and amplitude are found to be dependent on the membrane capacitance and axial resistivity, but not on the membrane resistivity. 4), The spike-amplitude decay with distance r is found to depend on dendritic morphology, and is decaying as 1/r(n) with 1 <or= n <or= 2 close to soma and n >or= 2 far away.},

abstract = {Power laws, that is, power spectral densities (PSDs) exhibiting 1/f($\alpha$) behavior for large frequencies f, have been observed both in microscopic (neural membrane potentials and currents) and macroscopic (electroencephalography; EEG) recordings. While complex network behavior has been suggested to be at the root of this phenomenon, we here demonstrate a possible origin of such power laws in the biophysical properties of single neurons described by the standard cable equation. Taking advantage of the analytical tractability of the so called ball and stick neuron model, we derive general expressions for the PSD transfer functions for a set of measures of neuronal activity: the soma membrane current, the current-dipole moment (corresponding to the single-neuron EEG contribution), and the soma membrane potential. These PSD transfer functions relate the PSDs of the respective measurements to the PSDs of the noisy input currents. With homogeneously distributed input currents across the neuronal membrane we find that all PSD transfer functions express asymptotic high-frequency 1/f($\alpha$) power laws with power-law exponents analytically identified as $\alpha$∞(I) = 1/2 for the soma membrane current, $\alpha$∞(p) = 3/2 for the current-dipole moment, and $\alpha$∞(V) = 2 for the soma membrane potential. Comparison with available data suggests that the apparent power laws observed in the high-frequency end of the PSD spectra may stem from uncorrelated current sources which are homogeneously distributed across the neural membranes and themselves exhibit pink (1/f) noise distributions. While the PSD noise spectra at low frequencies may be dominated by synaptic noise, our findings suggest that the high-frequency power laws may originate in noise from intrinsic ion channels. The significance of this finding goes beyond neuroscience as it demonstrates how 1/f($\alpha$) power laws with a wide range of values for the power-law exponent $\alpha$ may arise from a simple, linear partial differential equation.},

The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons
were analyzed from several preparations, and we selected the four
most prominent electrophysiological classes of neurons. These four
classes are "fast spiking", "regular spiking", "intrinsically bursting"
and "low-threshold spike" cells. For each class, we fit "minimal"
HH type models to experimental data. The models contain the minimal
set of voltage-dependent currents to account for the data. To obtain
models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations
in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus,
guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual
cortex and cat association cortex. For two cell classes, we used
automatic fitting procedures applied to several cells, which revealed
substantial cell-to-cell variability within each class. The selection
of such cellular models constitutes a necessary step towards building
network simulations of the thalamocortical system with realistic
cellular dynamical properties.},

abstract="Cortical spreading depression (SD) is a spreading disruption in brain ionic homeostasis during which neurons experience complete and prolonged depolarizations. SD is generally believed to be the physiological substrate of migraine aura and is associated with many other brain pathologies. Here, we perform simulations with a model of SD treating brain tissue as a triphasic continuum of neurons, glia and the extracellular space. A thermodynamically consistent incorporation of the major biophysical effects, including ionic electrodiffusion and osmotic water flow, allows for the computation of important physiological variables including the extracellular voltage (DC) shift. A systematic parameter study reveals that glia can act as both a disperser and buffer of potassium in SD propagation. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the DC shift with respect to extracellular {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}K{\}}^{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\$}K+rise is highly dependent on glial parameters, a result with implications for the identification of the propagating mechanism of SD.",

@article{Solbra2018,
abstract = {Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is currently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracellular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.},

abstract = {The extracellular space has an ambiguous role in neuroscience. It is present in every physiologically relevant system and often used as a measurement site in experimental recordings, but it has received subordinate attention compared to the intracellular domain. In computational modeling, it is often regarded as a passive, homogeneous resistive medium with a constant conductivity, which greatly simplifies the computation of extracellular potentials. However, recent studies have shown that local ionic diffusion and capacitive effects of electrically active membranes can have a substantial impact on the extracellular potential. These effects can not be described by traditional models, and they have been subject to theoretical and experimental analyses. We strive to give an overview over recent progress in modeling the extracellular space with special regard towards the concentration and potential dynamics on different temporal and spatial scales. Three models with distinct assumptions and levels of detail are compared both theoretically and by means of numerical simulations: the classical volume conductor (VC) model, which is most frequently used in form of the line source approximation (LSA); the very detailed, but computationally intensive Poisson-Nernst-Planck model of electrodiffusion (PNP); and an intermediate one called the electroneutral model (EN). The results clearly show that there is no one model for all applications, as they show significantly different responses especially close to neuronal membranes. Finally, we list some common use cases for model simulations and give recommendations on which model to use in each situation.},

Their exact biophysical basis is, however, still not fully understood. We present a three-dimensional model exploiting the cylinder symmetry of a single axon in extracellular fluid based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations of electrodiffusion. The propagation of an action potential along the axonal membrane is investigated by means of numerical simulations. Special attention is paid to the Debye layer, the region with strong concentration gradients close to the membrane, which is explicitly resolved by the computational mesh. We focus on the evolution of the extracellular electric potential. A characteristic up-down-up LFP waveform in the far-field is found. Close to the membrane, the potential shows a more intricate shape. A comparison with the widely used line source approximation reveals similarities and demonstrates the strong influence of membrane currents. However, the electrodiffusion model shows another signal component stemming directly from the intracellular electric field, called the action potential echo. Depending on the neuronal configuration, this might have a significant effect on the LFP. In these situations, electrodiffusion models should be used for quantitative comparisons with experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquaporin-4 water channels and the inwardly rectifying potassium channels Kir4.1 are coexpressed in a highly polarized manner at the perivascular and subvitreal endfeet of retinal M\"{u}ller cells and astrocytes. The present study was aimed at resolving the anchoring mechanisms responsible for the coexpression of these molecules. Both aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 contain PDZ-domain binding motifs at their C-termini and it was recently shown that mice with targeted disruption of the dystrophin gene display altered distribution of aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 in the retina. To test our hypothesis that alpha-syntrophin (a PDZ-domain containing protein of the dystrophin associated protein complex) is involved in aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 anchoring in retinal cells, we studied the expression pattern of these molecules in alpha-syntrophin null mice. Judged by quantitative immunogold cytochemistry, deletion of the alpha-syntrophin gene causes a partial loss (by 70\%) of aquaporin-4 labeling at astrocyte and M\"{u}ller cell endfeet but no decrease in Kir4.1 labeling at these sites. These findings suggest that alpha-syntrophin is not involved in the anchoring of Kir4.1 and only partly responsible for the anchoring of aquaporin-4 in retinal endfeet membranes. Furthermore we show that wild type and alpha-syntrophin null mice exhibit strong beta1 syntrophin labeling at perivascular and subvitreal M\"{u}ller cell endfeet, raising the possibility that beta1 syntrophin might be involved in the anchoring of Kir4.1 and the alpha-syntrophin independent pool of aquaporin-4.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs on dendrites determine the level of activity in neurons. Models based on the cable equation predict that silent shunting inhibition can strongly veto the effect of an excitatory input. The cable model assumes that ionic concentrations do not change during the electrical activity, which may not be a valid assumption, especially for small structures such as dendritic spines. We present here an analysis and computer simulations to show that for large Cl- conductance changes, the more general Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion model predicts that shunting inhibition on spines should be much less effective than that predicted by the cable model. This is a consequence of the large changes in the intracellular ionic concentration of Cl- that can occur in small structures, which would alter the reversal potential and reduce the driving force for Cl-. Shunting inhibition should therefore not be effective on spines, but it could be significantly more effective on the dendritic shaft at the base of the spine. In contrast to shunting inhibition, hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition mediated by K+ currents can be very effective in reducing the excitatory synaptic potentials on the same spine if the excitatory conductance change is less than 10 nS. We predict that if the inhibitory synapses found on cortical spines are to be effective, then they should be mediated by K+ through GABAB receptors.},

  Abstract                 = {Diabetes increases both the incidence of cardiovascular disease and complications of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Studies using diabetic animals have shown that changes in myocardial sodium transporters result in alterations in intracellular sodium (Na(i)) homeostasis. Because the changes in sodium homeostasis can be due to increased entry of Na+ via the electroneutral Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC), we conducted experiments in acute diabetic hearts to determine if 1) net inward cation flux via NKCC is increased, 2) this cotransporter contributes to a greater increase in Na(i) during ischemia, and 3) inhibition of NKCC limits injury and improves function after ischemia-reperfusion. These issues were investigated in perfused type I diabetic and nondiabetic rat hearts subjected to ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. A group of diabetic and nondiabetic hearts was perfused with 5 microM of bumetanide, an inhibitor of NKCC. Flux via NKCC, Na(i), and ATP was measured in each group with the use of radiotracer 86Rb, 23Na, and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively, whereas ischemic injury was assessed by measuring creatine kinase release on reperfusion. Cation flux via NKCC, as measured by 86Rb uptake, was significantly increased in diabetic hearts. Inhibition of NKCC significantly reduced ischemic injury in diabetic hearts, improved functional recovery on reperfusion, attenuated the ischemic rise in Na(i), and conserved ATP during ischemia-reperfusion. Parallel studies in nondiabetic hearts showed that NKCC inhibition was not cardioprotective. These findings demonstrate that flux via NKCC is increased in type I diabetic hearts and that inhibition with bumetanide attenuates changes in Na(i) and ATP during ischemia and protects against ischemic injury. The data suggest a therapeutic role for pharmacological agents that inhibit flux via NKCC in diabetic patients with myocardial ischemia.},

  Abstract                 = {1. We measured activity-dependent changes in [K+]o with K(+)-selective microelectrodes in adult rat optic nerve, a CNS white matter tract, to investigate the factors responsible for post-stimulus recovery of [K+]o. 2. Post-stimulus recovery of [K+]o followed a double-exponential time course with an initial, fast time constant, tau fast, of 0.9 +/- 0.2 s (mean +/- S.D.) and a later, slow time constant, tau slow, of 4.2 +/- 1 s following a 1 s, 100 Hz stimulus. tau fast, but not tau slow, decreased with increasing activity-dependent rises in [K+]o. tau slow, but not tau fast, increased with increasing stimulus duration. 3. Post-stimulus recovery of [K+]o was temperature sensitive. The apparent temperature coefficients (Q10, 27-37 degrees C) for the fast and slow components following a 1 s, 100 Hz stimulus were 1.7 and 2.6, respectively. 4. Post-stimulus recovery of [K+]o was sensitive to Na+ pump inhibition with 50 microM strophanthidin. Following a 1 s, 100 Hz stimulus, 50 microM strophanthidin increased tau fast and tau slow by 81 and 464\%, respectively. Strophanthidin reduced the temperature sensitivity of post-stimulus recovery of [K+]o. 5. Post-stimulus recovery of [K+]o was minimally affected by the K+ channel blocker Ba2+ (0.2 mM). Following a 10 s, 100 Hz stimulus, 0.2 mM Ba2+ increased tau fast and tau slow by 24 and 18\%, respectively. 6. Stimulated increases in [K+]o were followed by undershoots of [K+]o. Post-stimulus undershoot amplitude increased with stimulus duration but was independent of the peak preceding [K+]o increase. 7. These observations imply that two distinct processes contribute to post-stimulus recovery of [K+]o in central white matter. The results are compatible with a model of K+ removal that attributes the fast, initial phase of K+ removal to K+ uptake by glial Na+ pumps and the slower, sustained decline to K+ uptake via axonal Na+ pumps.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical research in the last decade revealed that astrocytes can respond to neurotransmitters with Ca(2+) elevations and generate feedback signals to neurons which modulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This discovery changed our basic understanding of brain function and provided new perspectives for how astrocytes can participate not only to information processing, but also to the genesis of brain disorders, such as epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures that can arise focally at restricted areas and propagate throughout the brain. Studies in brain slice models suggest that astrocytes contribute to epileptiform activity by increasing neuronal excitability through a Ca(2+)-dependent release of glutamate. The underlying mechanism remains, however, unclear. In this study, we implemented a parsimonious network model of neurons and astrocytes. The model consists of excitatory and inhibitory neurons described by Izhikevich's neuron dynamics. The experimentally observed Ca(2+) change in astrocytes in response to neuronal activity was modeled with linear equations. We considered that glutamate is released from astrocytes above certain intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations thus providing a non-linear positive feedback signal to neurons. Propagating seizure-like ictal discharges (IDs) were reliably evoked in our computational model by repeatedly exciting a small area of the network, which replicates experimental results in a slice model of focal ID in entorhinal cortex. We found that the threshold of focal ID generation was lowered when an excitatory feedback-loop between astrocytes and neurons was included. Simulations show that astrocytes can contribute to ID generation by directly affecting the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the neuronal network. Our model can be used to obtain mechanistic insights into the distinct contributions of the different signaling pathways to the generation and propagation of focal IDs.},

  Abstract                 = {Epilepsy is associated with significant neurological morbidity, including learning disabilities, motor deficits, and behavioral problems. Although the causes of neurological dysfunction in epilepsy are multifactorial, accumulating evidence indicates that seizures in themselves may directly cause brain injury. Although it is clear that seizures can result in neuronal death, it is likely that under some circumstances seizures can induce more subtle functional or structural alterations in neurons. We induced focal neocortical seizures with 4-aminopyridine in transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein in cortical neurons and sequentially imaged individual dendrites in living animals with two-photon laser-scanning microscopy to determine whether these seizures caused acute alterations in dendritic spine morphology. No dendritic alterations were observed in anesthetized animals during electrographic seizures over a 3-hour period. Similarly, in unanesthetized mice, low-stage, clinical electrographic seizures had minimal effect on dendritic spines. More severe, high-stage seizures in unanesthetized mice were associated with a moderate loss of spines and dendritic swelling, but this effect may have been contingent on a synergistic action of phototoxicity from the imaging method itself. Overall, our results suggest that most neocortical seizures have minimal acute effects on dendrites over several hours, but may predispose to dendritic injury under extreme conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The corpus callosum (CC) is the main white matter tract in the brain and is involved in interhemispheric communication. Using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique, a study was made of K(+)-currents in primary cultured astrocytes from the CC of newborn rats. These cells were positive to glial fibrillary acidic protein after culturing in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (> 95\% of cells) or in serum-free neurobasal medium with G5 supplement (> 99\% of cells). Astrocytes cultured in either medium displayed similar voltage-activated ion currents. In 81\% of astrocytes, the current had a transient component and a sustained component, which were blocked by 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium, respectively; and both had a reversal potential of -66 mV, indicating that they were carried by K(+) ions. Based on the Ba(2+)-sensitivity and activation kinetics of the K(+)-current, two groups of astrocytes were discerned. One group (55\% of cells) displayed a strong Ba(2+) blockade of the K(+)-current whose activation kinetics, time course of decay, and the current-voltage relationship were modified by Ba(2+). This current was greatly blocked (52\%) by Ba(2+) in a voltage-dependent way. Another group (45\% of cells) presented weak Ba(2+)-blockade, which was only blocked 24\% by Ba(2+). The activation kinetics and time course of decay of this current component were unaffected by Ba(2+). These results may help to understand better the roles of voltage-activated K(+)-currents in astrocytes from the rat CC in particular and glial cells in general.},

  Abstract                 = {For about six decades, primary current sources of the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been assumed dipolar in nature. In this study, we used electrophysiological recordings from anesthetized Wistar rats undergoing repeated whisker deflections to revise the biophysical foundations of the EEG dipolar model. In a first experiment, we performed three-dimensional recordings of extracellular potentials from a large portion of the barrel field to estimate intracortical multipolar moments generated either by single spiking neurons (i.e., pyramidal cells, PC; spiny stellate cells, SS) or by populations of them while experiencing synchronized postsynaptic potentials. As expected, backpropagating spikes along PC dendrites caused dipolar field components larger in the direction perpendicular to the cortical surface (49.7 ± 22.0 nA·mm). In agreement with the fact that SS cells have "close-field" configurations, their dipolar moment at any direction was negligible. Surprisingly, monopolar field components were detectable both at the level of single units (i.e., -11.7 ± 3.4 nA for PC) and at the mesoscopic level of mixed neuronal populations receiving extended synaptic inputs within either a cortical column (-0.44 ± 0.20 $\mu$A) or a 2.5-m(3)-voxel volume (-3.32 ± 1.20 $\mu$A). To evaluate the relationship between the macroscopically defined EEG equivalent dipole and the mesoscopic intracortical multipolar moments, we performed concurrent recordings of high-resolution skull EEG and laminar local field potentials. From this second experiment, we estimated the time-varying EEG equivalent dipole for the entire barrel field using either a multiple dipole fitting or a distributed type of EEG inverse solution. We demonstrated that mesoscopic multipolar components are altogether absorbed by any equivalent dipole in both types of inverse solutions. We conclude that the primary current sources of the EEG in the neocortex of rodents are not precisely represented by a single equivalent dipole and that the existence of monopolar components must be also considered at the mesoscopic level.},

In vitro lactacidosis induces swelling of glial cells by intracellular Na+- and Cl--accumulation by the Na+/H+-antiporter, Cl-/HCO3--antiporters and the Na+-K+-2Cl--cotransport. The present study aimed to elucidate whether mechanisms of lactacidosis-induced glial swelling are dependent on intra- or extracellular Ca2+-ions. Therefore, C6 glioma cells were exposed to a lactacidosis of pH 6.2 in standard or calcium-free medium and following intracellular calcium chelation. Cell volume and intracellular pH were assessed by flow cytometry. Lactacidosis of pH 6.2 induced a prompt and sustained swelling of suspended C6 glioma cells reaching a maximum of 128\% within 60 min. Omission of Ca2+ from the suspension medium strongly attenuated cell swelling while chelation of intracellular Ca2+ had no effects. Intracellular acidosis was not affected by either treatment. The present data show a strong dependency of lactacidosis-induced glial swelling upon extracellular Ca2+ while intracellular acidosis is not affected by omission of [Ca2+]e. Therefore, our data suggest that the Na+-K+-2Cl--cotransporter, the only so far known transporter involved in cell volume regulation but not in pHi regulation during lactacidosis, is activated in a [Ca2+]e-dependent manner.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines the contribution of anion transporters to the swelling and intracellular acidification of glial cells from an extracellular lactacidosis, a condition well-known to accompany cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury. Suspended C6 glioma cells were exposed to lactacidosis in physiological or anion-depleted media, and different anion transport inhibitors were applied. Changes in cell volume and intracellular pH (pH(i)) were simultaneously quantified by flow cytometry. Extracellular lactacidosis (pH 6.2) led to an increase in cell volume to 125.1 +/- 2.5\% of baseline within 60 min, whereas the pH(i) dropped from the physiological value of 7.13 +/- 0.05 to 6.32 +/- 0.03. Suspension in Cl(-)-free or HCO(3)(-)/CO(2)-free media or application of anion transport inhibitors [0.1 mM bumetanide or 0.5 mM 4, 4'-diisothio-cyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)] did not affect cell volume during baseline conditions but significantly reduced cell swelling from lactacidosis. In addition, the Cl(-)-free or HCO(3)(-)/CO(2)-free media and DIDS attenuated intracellular acidosis on extracellular acidification. From these findings it is concluded that besides the known activation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, activation of the Na(+)-independent Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger and the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter contributes to acidosis-induced glial swelling and the intracellular acidification. Inhibition of these processes may be of interest for future strategies in the treatment of cytotoxic brain edema from cerebral ischemia or traumatic brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {Heteromultimerization of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 leads to a channel with distinct functional properties. The heteromeric Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channel is expressed in the eye, kidney and brainstem and has CO(2)/pH sensitivity in the physiological range, suggesting a candidate molecule for the regulation of K(+) homeostasis and central CO(2) chemoreception. It is known that K(+) transport in renal epithelium and brainstem CO(2) chemosensitivity are subject to modulation by hormones and neurotransmitters that activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways. If the Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channel is involved in pH-dependent regulation of cellular functions, it may also be regulated by some of the intracellular signaling systems. Therefore, we undertook studies to determine whether PKC modulates the heteromeric Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channel. The channel expressed using a Kir4.1-Kir5.1 tandem dimer construct was inhibited by the PKC activator PMA in a dose-dependent manner. The channel inhibition was produced via reduction of the P(open). The effect of PMA was abolished by specific PKC inhibitors. In contrast, exposure of oocytes to forskolin (a PKA activator) had no significant effect on Kir4.1-Kir5.1 currents. The channel inhibition appeared to be independent of PIP(2) depletion and PKC-dependent internalization. Several consensus sequences of potential PKC phosphorylation sites were identified in the Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 subunits by sequence scan. Although the C-terminal peptides of both Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 were phosphorylated in vitro, site-directed mutagenesis of individual residues failed to reveal the PKC phosphorylation sites suggesting that the channel may have multiple phosphorylation sites. Taken together, these results suggest that the Kir4.1-Kir5.1 but not the homomeric Kir4.1 channel is strongly inhibited by PKC activation.},

  Abstract                 = {The SLC4 family consists of ten genes. All appear to encode integral membrane proteins with very similar hydropathy plots-consistent with the presence of 10-14 transmembrane segments. At least eight SLC4 members encode proteins that transport HCO(3)(-) (or a related species, such as CO(3)(2-)) across the plasma membrane. Functionally, these eight proteins fall into two major groups: three Cl-HCO(3) exchangers (AE1-3) and five Na(+)-coupled HCO(3)(-) transporters (NBCe1, NBCe2, NBCn1, NDCBE, NCBE). Two of the Na(+)-coupled HCO(3)(- )transporters (NBCe1, NBCe2) are electrogenic; the other three Na(+)-coupled HCO(3)(-) transporters and all three AEs are electroneutral. At least NDCBE transports Cl(-) in addition to Na(+) and HCO(3)(-). Whether NCBE transports Cl(-)-in addition to Na(+) and HCO(3)(-)-is unsettled. In addition, two other SLC4 members (AE4 and BTR1) do not yet have a firmly established function; on the basis of homology, they fall between the two major groups. A characteristic of many, though not all, SLC4 members is inhibition by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS). SLC4 gene products play important roles in the carriage of CO(2) by erythrocytes, the absorption or secretion of H(+) or HCO(3)(-) by several epithelia, as well as the regulation of cell volume and intracellular pH.},

  Abstract                 = {Dendritic spines are assumed to be the smallest units of neuronal integration. Because of their miniature size, however, many of their functional properties are still unclear. New insights in spine physiology have been provided by two-photon laser-scanning microscopy which allows fluorescence imaging with high spatial resolution and minimal photodamage. For example, two-photon imaging has been employed successfully for the measurement of activity-induced calcium transients in individual spines. Here, we describe the first application of two-photon imaging to measure Na+ transients in spines and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. Whole-cell patch-clamped neurons were loaded with the Na(+)-indicator dye SBFI (sodium-binding benzofuran-isophthalate). In situ calibration of SBFI fluorescence with ionophores enabled the determination of the actual magnitude of the [Na+]i changes. We found that back-propagating action potentials (APs) evoked Na+ transients throughout the proximal part of the dendritic tree and adjacent spines. The action-potential-induced [Na+]i transients reached values of 4 mM for a train of 20 APs and monotonically decayed with a time constant of several seconds. These results represent the first demonstration of activity-induced Na+ accumulation in spines. Our results demonstrate that two-photon Na+ imaging represents a powerful tool for extending our knowledge on Na+ signaling in fine cellular subcompartments.},

  Abstract                 = {1. We determined the intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) and mechanisms of its regulation in cultured rat hippocampal astrocytes using fluorescence ratio imaging of the Na+ indicator SBFI-AM (acetoxymethylester of sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate, 10 microM). Dye signal calibration within the astrocytes showed that the ratiometric dye signal changed monotonically with changes in [Na+]i from 0 to 140 nM. The K+ sensitivity of the dye was negligible; intracellular pH changes, however, slightly affected the 'Na+' signal. 2. Baseline [Na+]i was 14.6 +/- 4.9 mM (mean +/- S.D.) in CO2/HCO3(-)-containing saline with 3 mM K+. Removal of extracellular Na+ decreased [Na+]i in two phases: a rapid phase of [Na+]i reduction (0.58 +/- 0.32 mM min-1) followed by a slower phase (0.15 +/- 0.09 mM min-1). 3. Changing from CO2/HCO3(-)-free to CO2/HCO3(-)-buffered saline resulted in a transient increase in [Na+]i of approximately 5 mM, suggesting activation of inward Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport by CO2/HCO3-. During furosemide (frusemide, 1 mM) or bumetanide (50 microM) application, a slow decrease in [Na+]i of approximately 2 mM was observed, indicating a steady inward transport of Na+ via Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport under control conditions. Tetrodotoxin (100 microM) did not influence [Na+]i in the majority of cells (85\%), suggesting that influx of Na+ through voltage-gated Na+ channels contributed to baseline [Na+]i in only a small subpopulation of hippocampal astrocytes. 4. Blocking Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity with cardiac glycosides (ouabain or strophanthidin, 1 mM) or removal of extracellular K+ led to an increase in [Na+]i of about 2 and 4 mM min-1, respectively. This indicated that Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity was critical in maintaining low [Na+]i in the face of a steep electrochemical gradient, which would favour a much higher [Na+]i. 5. Elevation of extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) by as little as 1 mM (from 3 to 4 mM) resulted in a rapid and reversible decrease in [Na+]i. Both the slope and the amplitude of the [K+]o-induced reductions in [Na+]i were sensitive to bumetanide. A reduction of [K+]o by 1 mM increased [Na+]i by 3.0 +/- 2.3 mM. In contrast, changing extracellular Na+ concentration by 20 mM resulted in changes in [Na+]i of less than 3 mM. 6. These results implied that in hippocampal astrocytes low baseline [Na+]i is determined by the action of Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport, Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport and Na+, K(+)-ATPase, and that both Na+, K(+)-ATPase and inward Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl cotransport are activated by small, physiologically relevant increases in [K+]o. These mechanisms are well suited to help buffer increases in [K+]o associated with neural activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Monolayers of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells grown on permeable filters generated lactate aerobically and accumulated it preferentially in the basolateral compartment, suggesting the presence of a lactate carrier. The mechanism of lactate transport across apical and basolateral membranes was examined by determining intracellular pH (pHi) microspectrofluorimetrically after addition of lactate to the extracellular solutions and by measuring uptake of [14C]lactate. Addition of 20 mM lactate to the apical compartment produced no change in pHi, whereas lactate added to the basolateral compartment rapidly and reversibly lowered pHi. Pyruvate produced similar results. Inhibitors of lactate/H+ co-transporters, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CnCN) and quercetin, partially inhibited the fall in pHi produced by basolateral lactate. In contrast, the disulphonic stilbene. DIDS (4,4'-di-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid) produced no inhibition at 0.5 mM. Kinetic analysis was performed by applying basolateral lactate at various concentrations and measuring the rate of entry (delta pHi/min) in the presence and absence of CnCN. Lactate flux was shown to occur by both non-ionic diffusion and a alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate-sensitive component (carrier). The latter has a Km of approximately 7 mM for the lactate anion. Propionate, but not formate, lowered pHi to the same degree as did equimolar lactate, but the propionate effect was not inhibited by CnCN. Influx of [14C]lactate was substantially greater across the basolateral membrane than across the apical membrane and occurred in the absence of Na+. We conclude that MDCK cells grown on permeable filters generate lactate aerobically and transport it across the basolateral membrane by way of a lactate/H+ cotransporter.},

  Abstract                 = {The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) induces Ca2+-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes via the downstream action of prostaglandin (PG) E2. By this process, astrocytes may participate in intercellular communication and neuromodulation. Acute inflammation in vitro, induced by adding reactive microglia to astrocyte cultures, enhances TNFalpha production and amplifies glutamate release, switching the pathway into a neurodamaging cascade (Bezzi, P., Domercq, M., Brambilla, L., Galli, R., Schols, D., De Clercq, E., Vescovi, A., Bagetta, G., Kollias, G., Meldolesi, J., and Volterra, A. (2001) Nat. Neurosci. 4, 702-710). Because glial inflammation is a component of Alzheimer disease (AD) and TNFalpha is overexpressed in AD brains, we investigated possible alterations of the cytokine-dependent pathway in PDAPP mice, a transgenic model of AD. Glutamate release was measured in acute hippocampal and cerebellar slices from mice at early (4-month-old) and late (12-month-old) disease stages in comparison with age-matched controls. Surprisingly, TNFalpha-evoked glutamate release, normal in 4-month-old PDAPP mice, was dramatically reduced in the hippocampus of 12-month-old animals. This defect correlated with the presence of numerous beta-amyloid deposits and hypertrophic astrocytes. In contrast, release was normal in cerebellum, a region devoid of beta-amyloid deposition and astrocytosis. The Ca2+-dependent process by which TNFalpha evokes glutamate release in acute slices is distinct from synaptic release and displays properties identical to those observed in cultured astrocytes, notably PG dependence. However, prostaglandin E2 induced normal glutamate release responses in 12-month-old PDAPP mice, suggesting that the pathology-associated defect involves the TNFalpha-dependent control of secretion rather than the secretory process itself. Reduced expression of DENN/MADD, a mediator of TNFalpha-PG coupling, might account for the defect. Alteration of this neuromodulatory astrocytic pathway is described here for the first time in relation to Alzheimer disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The release of glutamate during brain anoxia or ischaemia triggers the death of neurons, causing mental or physical handicap. The mechanism of glutamate release is controversial, however. Four release mechanisms have been postulated: vesicular release dependent on external calcium or Ca2+ released from intracellular stores; release through swelling-activated anion channels; an indomethacin-sensitive process in astrocytes; and reversed operation of glutamate transporters. Here we have mimicked severe ischaemia in hippocampal slices and monitored glutamate release as a receptor-gated current in the CA1 pyramidal cells that are killed preferentially in ischaemic hippocampus. Using blockers of the different release mechanisms, we demonstrate that glutamate release is largely by reversed operation of neuronal glutamate transporters, and that it plays a key role in generating the anoxic depolarization that abolishes information processing in the central nervous system a few minutes after the start of ischaemia. A mathematical model incorporating K+ channels, reversible uptake carriers and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels reproduces the main features of the response to ischaemia. Thus, transporter-mediated glutamate homeostasis fails dramatically in ischaemia: instead of removing extracellular glutamate to protect neurons, transporters release glutamate, triggering neuronal death.},

  Abstract                 = {In astrocytes, calcium signals evoked by neurotransmitters appear as waves within single cells, which spread to other cells in the network. Recent analysis has shown that waves are initiated at a single invariant site in the cell and propagated within the cell in a nonlinear and saltatory manner by regenerative amplification at specific predestined cellular sites. In order to gain insight into local cellular waves and wave collisions we have developed a mathematical model of cellular wave amplification loci. This model is in good agreement with experimental data which includes: ambient calcium gradients in resting cells, wave origination and local amplification and generation of local waves. As observed in experiments, the model also predicts that different locations in the cell can have different frequencies of oscillation. The amplification loci are thought to be specialized areas of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane containing a higher density or higher sensitivity of IP3 receptors. Our analysis suggests that the cellular loci act as weakly coupled oscillators each with its intrinsic latency and frequency of oscillation. Thus the appearance of the propagated calcium wave may be a reflection of these differences rather than an actual diffusional wave propagation.},

Immunocytochemistry showed a comparable Kir4.1 protein expression pattern in M\"{u}ller cells from +/+ and -/- retinas, with greatest expression at their end feet. Osmotic water permeability was >4-fold reduced in -/- than in +/+ M\"{u}ller cells. Resting membrane potential did not differ significantly in +/+ versus -/- M\"{u}ller cells (-64 +/- 1 versus -64 +/- 1 mV, S.E., n = 24). Whole-cell K(+) currents recorded with a micropipette inserted into the cell soma were Ba(2+)-sensitive and showed no significant differences in magnitude in +/+ versus -/- M\"{u}ller cells (1.3 +/- 0.1 versus 1.2 +/- 0.1 nA at -160 mV) or in inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationships. Spatially resolved K(+) currents generated by pulsed K(+) injections along M\"{u}ller cell bodies were also comparable in +/+ versus -/- M\"{u}ller cells. Single-channel cell-attached patch clamp showed comparable unitary conductance, current-voltage data, and open probability in +/+ versus -/- M\"{u}ller cells. Thus, contrary to the generally accepted view, our results provide direct evidence against functionally significant AQP4 modulation of M\"{u}ller cell Kir4.1 K(+) channel function.},

Neither Cl influx nor efflux were affected by changes of internal Na concentration over the range of 8-158 mM. After ouabain and TTX treatment a portion of the remaining Na influx was directly dependent on the extracellular Cl concentration. Furthermore, when the internal Cl concentration was increased from 0 to 150 mM, the influxes of Cl and Na were decreased by 14 and 11 pmol/cm2.s, respectively. The influx of both ions could be substantially reduced when the axon was depleted of ATP. The influxes of both ions were inhibited by furosemide but unaffected by ouabain.

  Abstract                 = {Gap junction communication between astrocytes is prevalent and has been proposed to be involved in several astrocyte functions. One such proposal involves gap junctions in potassium spatial buffering. However, little is known about the developmental time course of gap junction coupling and how much the syncytium affects whole cell measurements of ion currents. Our previous work described three types of hippocampal astrocyte, each with a distinct electrophysiological profile when recorded in whole cell voltage-clamp mode. In the current study we correlated post-whole cell recording immunohistochemistry for GLAST and the spread of injected dye from the recorded cell with the measured electrophysiological phenotype to quantify cell coupling of astrocytes and the type of astrocyte coupled, in the rat hippocampus. We found that passive astrocytes, which predominate after 3 wk postnatally, have much lower membrane resistances (Rm) and are more frequently dye coupled and to more cells, than outwardly and variably rectifying astrocytes that predominate in early postnatal development. Dye coupling in GLAST(+) cells was first detected in the first postnatal week and the degree of coupling peaked before the complete transition to the low Rm, passive electrophysiological type. Also, the degree of dye coupling did not correlate with the passive electrophysiological phenotype. Passive cells were also detected after pretreatment with a gap junction inhibitor. Further evidence that cell coupling does not contribute to the mature astrocyte electrophysiological phenotype came from recording of excised membrane patches, which predominantly corresponded to the ion channel expression profiles of their cells of origin. These findings imply that in the hippocampus, interastrocyte cell coupling likely contributes little to the overall whole cell current profile of diverse glia, and the electrophysiological passivity reflects the intrinsic ion channel expression of the mature astrocyte.},

Rall, Handbook of Physiology, Section 1, vol. 1, Part 1, American Physiological Society, Bethesda, 1977, pp. 39-97]. In order to determine if changes in developing M\"{u}ller cells improve or worsen their capability of carrying K+ spatial buffering currents, we compared the whole-cell currents of acutely isolated M\"{u}ller cells at 5, 11 and 28 postnatal days of rabbits. Both K+-spatial buffer limitations described above were found in early postnatal stage (5 days), however, the cells overcome these limitations shortly after 11 days. During the period of 11-28 days, rabbit M\"{u}ller cells simultaneously increase stalk axial conductance and express Kir channels. Both processes take place during the critical stage of retinal maturation, and should dramatically improve "cable" K+-spatial buffering.},

The anomalous titration required for lysine operating in the neutral pH range results from its close interaction with two positively charged arginines from the distant N- and C-termini termed the R/K/R triad. Disturbance of this triad as results from a number of point mutations found in patients with hyperprostaglandin E syndrome (HPS) increases the pKa of the pH sensor and results in channels being permanently inactivated under physiological conditions. This article will focus on the mechanism of pH-gating, its implications for the tertiary structure of Kir proteins and on its significance for the pathogenesis of HPS.},

EAATs also mediate a thermodynamically uncoupled substrate-gated anion conductance that may modulate cell excitability. Here, we demonstrate that modification of a cysteine substituted within a C-terminal domain of EAAT1 abolishes transport in both the forward and reverse directions without affecting activation of the anion conductance. EC(50)s for L-glutamate and sodium are significantly lower after modification, consistent with kinetic models of the transport cycle that link anion channel gating to an early step in substrate translocation. Also, decreasing the pH from 7.5 to 6.5 decreases the EC(50) for L-glutamate to activate the anion conductance, without affecting the EC(50) for the entire transport cycle. These findings demonstrate for the first time a structural separation of transport and the uncoupled anion flux. Moreover, they shed light on some controversial aspects of the EAAT transport cycle, including the kinetics of proton binding and anion conductance activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes in different brain regions display variable functional properties. In the hippocampus, astrocytes predominantly express time- and voltage-independent currents, but the underlying ion channels are not well defined. This ignorance is partly attributable to abundant intercellular coupling of these cells through gap junctions, impeding quantitative analyses of intrinsic membrane properties. Moreover, distinct types of cells with astroglial properties coexist in a given brain area, a finding that confused previous analyses. In the present study, we investigated expression of inwardly rectifying (Kir) and two-pore-domain (K2P) K+ channels in astrocytes, which are thought to be instrumental in the regulation of K+ homeostasis. Freshly isolated astrocytes were used to improve space-clamp conditions and allow for quantitative assessment of functional parameters. Patch-clamp recordings were combined with immunocytochemistry, Western blot analysis, and semiquantitative transcript analysis. Comparative measurements were performed in different CA1 subregions of astrocyte-targeted transgenic mice. While confirming weak Ba2+ sensitivity in situ, our data demonstrate that in freshly isolated astrocytes, the main proportion of membrane currents is sensitive to micromolar Ba2+ concentrations. Upregulation of Kir4.1 transcripts and protein during the first 10 postnatal days was accompanied by a fourfold increase in astrocyte inward current density. Hippocampal astrocytes from Kir4.1-/- mice lacked Ba2+-sensitive currents. In addition, we report functional expression of K2P channels of the TREK subfamily (TREK1, TREK2), which mediate astroglial outward currents. Together, our findings demonstrate that Kir4.1 constitutes the pivotal K+ channel subunit and that superposition of currents through Kir4.1 and TREK channels underlies the "passive" current pattern of hippocampal astrocytes.},

Simulations predict that SD will not occur unless cells are allowed to expand in response to osmotic pressure gradients and K+ is allowed to move through gap junctions. SD waves of [K+]out approximately 25 to approximately 60 mM moving at approximately 2 to approximately 18 mm/min are predicted over the range of parametric values reported in gray matter, with extracellular space decreasing up to approximately 50\%. Predicted waveform shape is qualitatively similar to laboratory reports. The delayed-rectifier, NMDA, BK, and Na+ currents are predicted to facilitate SD, while SK and A-type K+ currents and glial activity impede SD. These predictions are consonant with recent findings that gap junction poisons block SD and support the theories that cytosolic diffusion via gap junctions and osmotic forces are important mechanisms underlying SD.},

While some studies showed that \{HFS\} inhibits the stimulated nucleus, others report excitation. In this in vitro study, we stimulated the rat globus pallidus interna (entopeduncular nucleus, EP), a commonly stimulated area for Parkinson’s disease, to investigate the effect of HFS-induced elevation of extracellular potassium (K+e) on rat \{EP\} neuronal activity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and [K+]e measurements were obtained in rat \{EP\} brain slices before, during and after HFS. After \{HFS\} (150 Hz, 10 s), [K+]e increased from 2.5–9.6±1.4 mM, the resting membrane potential of \{EP\} neurons depolarized by 11.1±2.5 mV, spiking activity was significantly depressed, and input resistance decreased by 25±6%. The \{GABAA\} receptor blocker, gabazine, did not prevent these effects. The bath perfusion of 6 or 10 mM K+, with or without synaptic blockers, mimicked the HFS-mediated effects: inhibition of spike activity, a 20±9% decrease in input resistance and a 17.4±3.0 mV depolarization. This depolarization exceeded predicted values of elevated [K+]e on the resting membrane potential. A depolarization block did not fully account for the K+-induced inhibition of \{EP\} neuronal activity. Taken together, our results show that HFS-induced elevation of [K+]e decreased \{EP\} neuronal activity by the activation of an ion conductance resulting in membrane depolarization, independent of synaptic involvement. These findings could explain the inhibitory effects of \{HFS\} on neurons of the stimulated nucleus.},

  Abstract                 = {White blood cell neutrophil is a key component in the fast initial immune response against bacterial and fungal infections. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) which is naturally produced in the body, is known to control the neutrophils production in the bone marrow and the neutrophils delivery into the blood. In oncological practice, G-CSF injections are widely used to treat neutropenia (dangerously low levels of neutrophils in the blood) and to prevent the infectious complications that often follow chemotherapy. However, the accurate dynamics of G-CSF neutrophil interaction has not been fully determined and no general scheme exists for an optimal G-CSF application in neutropenia. Here we develop a two-dimensional ordinary differential equation model for the G-CSF-neutrophil dynamics in the blood. The model is built axiomatically by first formally defining from the biology the expected properties of the model, and then deducing the dynamic behavior of the resulting system. The resulting model is structurally stable, and its dynamical features are independent of the precise form of the various rate functions. Choosing a specific form for these functions, three complementary parameter estimation procedures for one clinical (training) data set are utilized. The fully parameterized model (6 parameters) provides adequate predictions for several additional clinical data sets on time scales of several days. We briefly discuss the utility of this relatively simple and robust model in several clinical conditions.},

[Na+]i is about 20 mM, [K+]i is 130 mM and [Ca2+]i is less than 100 nM. Under non-stimulated conditions, the Na+/K+ ATPase consumes 20\% of astrocytic ATP production. Inhibition of the pump by ouabain decreases energy expenditure, raises [creatine phosphate]/[creatine], and leads to a leakage of sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. Decrease in the pump function via a fall in [ATP] also collapses ion gradients; the rate and extent of the fall correlates positively with cellular energy state. Under "normal" conditions (i.e., when ATP production pathways are not inhibited), there appears to be no preferential utilization of energy produced by either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation for the support of pump function.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes are highly complex cells that respond to a variety of external stimulations. One of the chief functions of astrocytes is to optimize the interstitial space for synaptic transmission by tight control of water and ionic homeostasis. Several lines of work have, over the past decade, expanded the role of astrocytes and it is now clear that astrocytes are active participants in the tri-partite synapse and modulate synaptic activity in hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus. Thus, the emerging concept of astrocytes includes both supportive functions as well as active modulation of neuronal output. Glutamate plays a central role in astrocytic-neuronal interactions. This excitatory amino acid is cleared from the neuronal synapses by astrocytes via glutamate transporters, and is converted into glutamine, which is released and in turn taken up by neurons. Furthermore, metabotropic glutamate receptor activation on astrocytes triggers via increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) a variety of responses. For example, calcium-dependent glutamate release from the astrocytes modulates the activity of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In vivo studies have identified the astrocytic end-foot processes enveloping the vessel walls as the center for astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling and it is possible that Ca(2+) signaling events in the cellular component of the blood-brain barrier are instrumental in modulation of local blood flow as well as substrate transport. The hormonal regulation of water and ionic homeostasis is achieved by the opposing effects of vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide on astroglial water and chloride uptake. In conjuncture, the brain appears to have a distinct astrocytic perivascular system, involving several potassium channels as well as aquaporin 4, a membrane water channel, which has been localized to astrocytic endfeet and mediate water fluxes within the brain. The multitask functions of astrocytes are essential for higher brain function. One of the major challenges for future studies is to link receptor-mediated signaling events in astrocytes to their roles in metabolism, ion, and water homeostasis.},

While calcium channels are of critical importance to brain function, their inappropriate expression or dysfunction gives rise to a variety of neurological disorders, including, pain, epilepsy, migraine, and ataxia. This Review discusses salient aspects of voltage-gated calcium channel function, physiology, and pathophysiology.},

  Abstract                 = {Earlier studies indicate a crucial role for the interconnected network of intrinsically bursting CA3 pyramidal neurons in the generation of in vivo hippocampal sharp waves (SPWs) and their proposed neonatal in vitro counterparts, the giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs). While mechanisms involving ligand- and voltage-gated channels have received lots of attention in the generation of CA3 network events in the immature hippocampus, the contribution of ion-transport mechanisms has not been extensively studied. Here, we show that bumetanide, a selective inhibitor of neuronal Cl- uptake mediated by the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), completely and reversibly blocks SPWs in the neonate (postnatal days 7-9) rat hippocampus in vivo, an action also seen on GDPs in slices (postnatal days 1-8). These findings strengthen the view that GDPs and early SPWs are homologous events. Gramicidin-perforated patch recordings indicated that NKCC1 accounts for a large ( approximately 10 mV) depolarizing driving force for the GABAA current in the immature CA3 pyramids. Consistent with a reduction in the depolarization mediated by endogenous GABAA-receptor activation, bumetanide inhibited the spontaneous bursts of individual neonatal CA3 pyramids, but it slightly increased the interneuronal activity as seen in the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic currents. An inhibitory effect of bumetanide was seen on the in vitro population events in the absence of synaptic GABAA receptor-mediated transmission, provided that a tonic GABAA receptor-mediated current was present. Our work indicates that NKCC1 expressed in CA3 pyramidal neurons promotes network activity in the developing hippocampus.},

Astrocytes probably restrain the rise of K(+) in a way that is only partly understood. To examine the effect of glial K(+) uptake, we used a model neuron equipped with Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+) and Cl(-) conductances, ion pumps and ion exchangers, surrounded by interstitial space and glia. The glial membrane was either "passive", incorporating only leak channels and an ion exchange pump, or it had rectifying K(+) channels. We computed ion fluxes, concentration changes and osmotic volume changes. Increase of [K(+)](o) stimulated the glial uptake by the glial 3Na/2K ion pump. The [K(+)](o) flux through glial leak and rectifier channels was outward as long as the driving potential was outwardly directed, but it turned inward when rising [K(+)](o)/[K(+)](i) ratio reversed the driving potential. Adjustments of glial membrane parameters influenced the neuronal firing patterns, the length of paroxysmal afterdischarge and the ignition point of spreading depression. We conclude that voltage gated K(+) currents can boost the effectiveness of the glial "potassium buffer" and that this buffer function is important even at moderate or low levels of excitation, but especially so in pathological states.},

We have now engineered hexa-Ala ((A)6) and individual amino acid substitutions to investigate the importance to pH-dependent regulation of AE2 activity of the larger surrounding region of aa 312-578. 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)-sensitive 36Cl- efflux from AE2-expressing Xenopus oocytes was monitored during changes in pHi or pHo in HEPES-buffered and in 5\% CO2/HCO3- -buffered conditions. Wild-type AE2-mediated 36Cl- efflux was profoundly inhibited at low pHo, with a pHo(50) value = 6.75 +/- 0.05 and was stimulated up to 10-fold by intracellular alkalinization. Individual mutation of several amino acid residues at non-contiguous sites preceding or following the conserved sequence aa 336-347 attenuated pHi and/or pHo sensitivity of 36Cl- efflux. The largest attenuation of pH sensitivity occurred with the AE2 mutant (A)6357-362. This effect was phenocopied by AE2 H360E, suggesting a crucial role for His360. Homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the AE2 NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain (based on the structure of the corresponding region of human AE1) predicts that those residues shown by mutagenesis to be functionally important define at least one localized surface region necessary for regulation of AE2 activity by pH.},

  Abstract                 = {Electron probe x-ray microanalysis (EPMA) was used to measure water content (percent water) and dry weight elemental concentrations (in millimoles per kilogram) of Na, K, Cl, and Ca in axoplasm and mitochondria of rat optic and tibial nerve myelinated axons. Myelin and cytoplasm of glial cells were also analyzed. Each anatomical compartment exhibited characteristic water contents and distributions of dry weight elements, which were used to calculate respective ionized concentrations. Free axoplasmic [K+] ranged from approximately 155 mM in large PNS and CNS axons to approximately 120-130 mM in smaller fibers. Free [Na+] was approximately 15-17 mM in larger fibers compared with 20-25 mM in smaller axons, whereas free [Cl-] was found to be 30-55 mM in all axons. Because intracellular Ca is largely bound, ionized concentrations were not estimated. However, calculations of total (free plus bound) aqueous concentrations of this element showed that axoplasm of large CNS and PNS axons contained approximately 0.7 mM Ca, whereas small fibers contained 0.1-0.2 mM. Calculated ionic equilibrium potentials were as follows (in mV): in large CNS and PNS axons, E(K) = -105, E(Na) = 60, and E(Cl) = -28; in Schwann cells, E(K) = -107, E(Na) = 33, and E(Cl) = -33; and in CNS glia, E(K) = -99, E(Na) = 36, and E(Cl) = -44. Calculated resting membrane potentials were as follows (in mV, including the contribution of the Na+,K+-ATPase): large axons, about -80; small axons, about -72 to -78; and CNS glia, -91. E(Cl) is more positive than resting membrane potential in PNS and CNS axons and glia, indicating active accumulation. Direct EPMA measurement of elemental concentrations and subsequent calculation of ionized fractions in axons and glia offer fundamental neurophysiological information that has been previously unattainable.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, we examined the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter activity and expression in rat cortical astrocyte differentiation. Astrocyte differentiation was induced by dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP, 0. 25 mM) for 7 days, and cells changed from a polygonal to process-bearing morphology. Basal activity of the cotransporter was significantly increased in DBcAMP-treated astrocytes (P < 0.05). Expression of an approximately 161-kDa cotransporter protein was increased by 91\% in the DBcAMP-treated astrocytes. Moreover, the specific [(3)H]bumetanide binding was increased by 67\% in the DBcAMP-treated astrocytes. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cyclohexamide (2-3 microgram/ml) significantly attenuated the DBcAMP-mediated upregulation of the cotransporter activity and expression. The Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter in astrocytes has been suggested to play a role in K(+) uptake. In 75 mM extracellular K(+) concentration, the cotransporter-mediated K(+) influx was stimulated by 147\% in nontreated cells and 79\% in DBcAMP-treated cells (P < 0.05). To study whether this high K(+)-induced stimulation of the cotransporter is attributed to membrane depolarization and Ca(2+) influx, the role of the L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel was investigated. The high-K(+)-mediated stimulation of the cotransporter activity was abolished in the presence of either 0.5 or 1.0 microM of the L-type channel blocker nifedipine or Ca(2+)-free HEPES buffer. A rise in intracellular free Ca(2+) in astrocytes was observed in high K(+). These results provide the first evidence that the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter protein expression can be regulated selectively when intracellular cAMP is elevated. The study also demonstrates that the cotransporter in astrocytes is stimulated by high K(+) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner.},

  Abstract                 = {Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporters are important in renal salt reabsorption and in salt secretion by epithelia. They are also essential in maintenance and regulation of ion gradients and cell volume in both epithelial and nonepithelial cells. Expression of Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporters in brain tissues is high; however, little is known about their function and regulation in neurons. In this study, we examined regulation of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The cotransporter activity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells was assessed by bumetanide-sensitive K+ influx, and protein expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Glutamate was found to induce a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter activity in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, both the glutamate ionotropic receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and the metabotropic receptor agonist (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD) significantly stimulated the cotransport activity in these cells. NMDA-mediated stimulation of the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter was abolished by the selective NMDA-receptor antagonist (+)-MK-801 hydrogen maleate. trans-ACPD-mediated effect on the cotransporter was blocked by the metabotropic receptor antagonist (+)-alpha-methyl-(4-carboxyphenyl)glycine. The results demonstrate that Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporters in neurons are regulated by activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors.},

  Abstract                 = {Guidance of axons to their targets in the developing nervous system requires a myriad of downstream signaling molecules to coordinate growth cone movement. One of the most important of these is calcium, and over the past few years many new insights have been gained into the role of calcium in axon guidance. In this review we focus on mechanisms of calcium entry into the growth cone and its downstream effects on both growth cone motility and turning. We particularly highlight the role of calcium concentrations in determining attractive versus repulsive responses to graded guidance cues, and their role in guidance by the morphogen Wnt5a.},

abstract = {Advances in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of devices containing arrays of thousands of closely spaced recording electrodes, which afford subcellular resolution of electrical signals in neurons and neuronal networks. Rationalizing the electrode size and configuration in such arrays demands consideration of application-specific requirements and inherent features of the electrodes. Tradeoffs among size, spatial density, sensitivity, noise, attenuation, and other factors are inevitable. Although recording extracellular signals from neurons with planar metal electrodes is fairly well established, the effects of the electrode characteristics on the quality and utility of recorded signals, especially for small, densely packed electrodes, have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we present a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidating how electrode size, and size-dependent parameters, such as impedance, baseline noise, and transmission characteristics, influence recorded neuronal signals. Using arrays containing platinum electrodes of different sizes, we experimentally evaluated the electrode performance in the recording of local field potentials (LFPs) and extracellular action potentials (EAPs) from the following cell preparations: acute brain slices, dissociated cell cultures, and organotypic slice cultures. Moreover, we simulated the potential spatial decay of point-current sources to investigate signal averaging using known signal sources. We demonstrated that the noise and signal attenuation depend more on the electrode impedance than on electrode size, per se, especially for electrodes {\textless}10 $\mu$m in width or diameter to achieve high-spatial-resolution readout. By minimizing electrode impedance of small electrodes ({\textless}10 $\mu$m) via surface modification, we could maximize the signal-to-noise ratio to electrically visualize the propagation of axonal EAPs and to isolate single-unit spikes. Due to the large amplitude of LFP signals, recording quality was high and nearly independent of electrode size. These findings should be of value in configuring in vitro and in vivo microelectrode arrays for extracellular recordings with high spatial resolution in various applications.},

abstract = {Understanding brain functions at the circuit level requires time-resolved simultaneous measurement of a large number of densely distributed neurons, which remains a great challenge for current neural technologies. In particular, penetrating neural electrodes allow for recording from individual neurons at high temporal resolution, but often have larger dimensions than the biological matrix, which induces significant damage to brain tissues and therefore precludes the high implant density that is necessary for mapping large neuronal populations with full coverage. Here, it is demonstrated that nanofabricated ultraflexible electrode arrays with cross-sectional areas as small as sub-10 �m 2 can overcome this physical limitation. In a mouse model, it is shown that these electrodes record action potentials with high signal-to-noise ratio; their dense arrays allow spatial oversampling; and their multiprobe implantation allows for interprobe spacing at 60 �m without eliciting chronic neuronal degeneration. These results present the possibility of minimizing tissue displacement by implanted ultraflexible electrodes for scalable, high-density electrophysiological recording that is capable of complete neuronal circuitry mapping over chronic time scales.},

abstract = {The pathological phenomena of seizures and spreading depression have long been considered separate physiological events in the brain. By incorporating conservation of particles and charge, and accounting for the energy required to restore ionic gradients, we extend the classic Hodgkin-Huxley formalism to uncover a unification of neuronal membrane dynamics. By examining the dynamics as a function of potassium and oxygen, we now account for a wide range of neuronal activities, from spikes to seizures, spreading depression (whether high potassium or hypoxia induced), mixed seizure and spreading depression states, and the terminal anoxic "wave of death." Such a unified framework demonstrates that all of these dynamics lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane. Our results demonstrate that unified frameworks for neuronal dynamics are feasible, can be achieved using existing biological structures and universal physical conservation principles, and may be of substantial importance in enabling our understanding of brain activity and in the control of pathological states. {\textcopyright} 2014 the authors.},

abstract = {Spreading depression (SD) and the related hypoxic SD-like depolarization (HSD) are characterized by rapid and nearly complete depolarization of a sizable population of brain cells with massive redistribution of ions between intracellular and extracellular compartments, that evolves as a regenerative, "all-or-none" type process, and propagates slowly as a wave in brain tissue. This article reviews the characteristics of SD and HSD and the main hypotheses that have been proposed to explain them. Both SD and HSD are composites of concurrent processes. Antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels or voltage-gated Na+ or certain types of Ca2+ channels can postpone or mitigate SD or HSD, but it takes a combination of drugs blocking all known major inward currents to effectively prevent HSD. Recent computer simulation confirmed that SD can be produced by positive feedback achieved by increase of extracellular K+ concentration that activates persistent inward currents which then activate K+ channels and release more K+. Any slowly inactivating voltage and/or K+-dependent inward current could generate SD-like depolarization, but ordinarily, it is brought about by the cooperative action of the persistent Na+ current INa,P plus NMDA receptor-controlled current. SD is ignited when the sum of persistent inward currents exceeds persistent outward currents so that total membrane current turns inward. The degree of depolarization is not determined by the number of channels available, but by the feedback that governs the SD process. Short bouts of SD and HSD are well tolerated, but prolonged depolarization results in lasting loss of neuron function. Irreversible damage can, however, be avoided if Ca2+ influx into neurons is prevented.},

abstract = {Microelectrode array recordings of neuronal activity present significant opportunities for studying the brain with single-cell and spike-time precision. However, challenges in device manufacturing constrain dense multisite recordings to two spatial dimensions, whereas access to the three-dimensional (3D) structure of many brain regions appears to remain a challenge. To overcome this limitation, we present two novel recording modalities of silicon-based devices aimed at establishing 3D functionality. First, we fabricated a dual-side electrode array by patterning recording sites on both the front and back of an implantable microstructure. We found that the majority of single-unit spikes could not be simultaneously detected from both sides, suggesting that in addition to providing higher spatial resolution measurements than that of single-side devices, dual-side arrays also lead to increased recording yield. Second, we obtained recordings along three principal directions with a multi-layer array and demonstrated 3D spike source localization within the enclosed measurement space. The large-scale integration of such dual-side and multilayer arrays is expected to provide massively parallel recording capabilities in the brain.

  Abstract                 = {Cell swelling and astrogliosis (manifested as an increase in GFAP) were evoked in isolated rat spinal cords of 4-21-day-old rats by incubation in either 50 mM K+ or hypotonic solution (235 mosmol kg(-1)). Application of K+ and hypotonic solution resulted at first in a decrease of extracellular space (ECS) volume fraction alpha (ECS volume/total tissue volume) and an increase in tortuosity lambda (lambda2 = free/apparent diffusion coefficient) in spinal gray (GM) and white matter (WM). These changes resulted from cell swelling, since the total water content (TW) in spinal cord was unchanged and the changes were blocked in Cl- -free solution and slowed down by furosemide and bumetanide. Diffusion in WM was anisotropic, i.e., more facilitated along fibers (x-axis) than across them (y- or z-axis). The increase of lambda(y,z) was greater than that of lambda(x), reaching unusually high values above 2.4. In GM only, during continuous 45 min application, alpha and lambda started to return towards control values, apparently due to cell shrinkage of previously swollen cells since TW remained unchanged. This return was blocked by fluoroacetate, suggesting that most of the changes were due to the swelling of glia. A 45 min application of 50 mM K+ and, to a lesser degree, of hypotonic solution evoked astrogliosis, which persisted after washing out these solutions with physiological saline. During astrogliosis lambda increased again to values as high as 2.0, while alpha either returned to or increased above control values. This persistent increase in lambda after washout was also found in WM, and, in addition, the typical diffusion anisotropy was diminished. Our data show that glial swelling and astrogliosis are associated with a persistent increase in ECS diffusion barriers. This could lead to the impairment of the diffusion of neuroactive substances, extrasynaptic transmission, "crosstalk" between synapses and neuron-glia communication.},

We imaged the activity of astrocytes labeled with the calcium (Ca(2+))-sensitive indicator rhod-2 in somatosensory cortex of adult mice. Photolysis of caged Ca(2+) in astrocytic endfeet ensheathing the vessel wall was associated with an 18\% increase in arterial cross-section area that corresponded to a 37\% increase in blood flow. Vasodilation occurred with a latency of only 1-2 s, and both indomethacin and the cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor SC-560 blocked the photolysis-induced hyperemia. These observations implicate astrocytes in the control of local microcirculation and suggest that one of their physiological roles is to mediate vasodilation in response to increased neural activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Glutamine is a primary precursor for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is proposed that glutamine, synthesized and released by astrocytes, is transported into the neuron for subsequent conversion to neurotransmitters. To provide a more complete characterization of this process, we have delineated the transport systems for glutamine uptake in primary cultures of brain neuronal cells from 1-day-old rats. The Na(+)-dependent glutamine entry is mediated by system A, system ASC, and a third, previously unidentified, activity that has been tentatively designated as system Nb. System Nb activity can be monitored by assaying Na(+)-dependent [3H]glutamine uptake in the presence of 2 mM concentrations of both 2-(methylamino) isobutyric acid and threonine to block uptake by systems A and ASC, respectively. The newly identified transport activity exhibits an apparent substrate specificity that is unique compared with the hepatic system N, because it is inhibited by glutamine and asparagine, but not by histidine. Also, the affinity of system Nb for glutamine, as estimated from K(m) values, is significantly greater than that observed for the hepatic and muscle Na(+)-dependent glutamine transporters, systems N and Nm. In sharp contrast to the hepatic system N transporter, system Nb exhibits a relative insensitivity to pH and does not permit Li+ substitution for Na+ as the cosubstrate. The substrate specificity, kinetic analysis, pH sensitivity, and cation dependence of this transport activity indicate that it represents a glutamine transport system not previously identified.},

  Abstract                 = {Capacitance is a fundamental neuronal property. One common way to measure capacitance is to deliver a small voltage-clamp step that is long enough for the clamp current to come to steady state, and then to divide the integrated transient charge by the voltage-clamp step size. In an isopotential neuron, this method is known to measure the total cell capacitance. However, in a cell that is not isopotential, this measures only a fraction of the total capacitance. This has generally been thought of as measuring the capacitance of the "well-clamped" part of the membrane, but the exact meaning of this has been unclear. Here, we show that the capacitance measured in this way is a weighted sum of the total capacitance, where the weight for a given small patch of membrane is determined by the voltage deflection at that patch, as a fraction of the voltage-clamp step size. This quantifies precisely what it means to measure the capacitance of the "well-clamped" part of the neuron. Furthermore, it reveals that the voltage-clamp step method measures a well-defined quantity, one that may be more useful than the total cell capacitance for normalizing conductances measured in voltage-clamp in nonisopotential cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Spreading depression (SD) and related phenomena have been implicated in hypoxic-ischemic injury. In such settings, SD occurs in the presence of marked extracellular acidosis. SD itself can also generate changes in extracellular pH (pH(o)), including a pronounced early alkaline shift. In a hippocampal slice model, we investigated the effect of interstitial acidosis on the generation and propagation of SD in the CA1 stratum radiatum. In addition, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (benzolamide) was used to decrease buffering of the alkaline shift to investigate its role in the modulation of SD. pH(o) was lowered by a decrease in saline HCO(3)(-) (from 26 to 13 to 6.5 mM at 5\% CO(2)), or by an increase in the CO(2) content (from 5 to 15\% in 26 mM HCO(3)(-)). Recordings with pH microelectrodes revealed respective pHo values of 7.23 +/- 0. 13, 6.95 +/- 0.10, 6.67 +/- 0.09, and 6.97 +/- 0.12. The overall effect of acidosis was an increase in the threshold for SD induction, a decrease in velocity, and a shortened SD duration. This inhibition was most pronounced at the lowest pH(o) (in 6.5 mM HCO(3)(-)) where SD was often blocked. The effects of acidosis were reversible on return to control saline. Benzolamide (10 microM) caused an approximate doubling of the early alkaline shift to an amplitude of 0.3-0.4 U pH. The amplified alkalosis was associated with an increased duration and/or increased velocity of the wave. These effects were most pronounced in acidic media (13 mM HCO(3)(-)/5\% CO(2)) where benzolamide increased the SD duration by 55 +/- 32\%. The initial velocity (including time for induction) and propagation velocity (measured between distal electrodes) were enhanced by 35 +/- 25 and 26 +/- 16\%, respectively. Measurements of [Ca(2+)](o) demonstrated an increase in duration of the Ca(2+) transient when the alkaline shift was amplified by benzolamide. The augmentation of SD caused by benzolamide was blocked in media containing the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. These data indicate that the induction and propagation of SD is inhibited by a fall in baseline pH characteristic of ischemic conditions and that the early alkaline shift can remove this inhibition by relieving the proton block on NMDA receptors. Under ischemic conditions, the intrinsic alkalosis may therefore enable SD and thereby contribute to NMDA receptor-mediated injury.},

  Abstract                 = {The kinetics of activity-dependent, extracellular alkaline transients, and the buffering of extracellular pH (pH(e)), were studied in rat hippocampal slices using a fluorescein-dextran probe. Orthodromic stimuli generated alkaline transients < or = 0.05 pH units that peaked in 273 +/- 26 ms and decayed with a half-time of 508 +/- 43 ms. Inhibition of extracellular carbonic anhydrase (ECA) with benzolamide increased the rate of rise by 25\%, doubled peak amplitude, and prolonged the decay three- to fourfold. The slow decay in benzolamide allowed marked temporal summation, resulting in a severalfold increase in amplitude during long stimulus trains. Addition of exogenous carbonic anhydrase reduced the rate of rise, halved the peak amplitude, but had no effect on the normalized decay. A simulation of extracellular buffering kinetics generated recoveries from a base load consistent with the observed decay of the alkaline transient in the presence of benzolamide. Under control conditions, the model approximated the observed decays with an acceleration of the CO2 hydration-dehydration reactions by a factor of 2.5. These data suggest low endogenous ECA activity, insufficient to maintain equilibrium during the alkaline transients. Disequilibrium implies a time-dependent buffering capacity, with a CO2/HCO3- contribution that is small shortly after a base load. It is suggested that within 100 ms, extracellular buffering capacity is about 1\% of the value at equilibrium and is provided mainly by phosphate. Accordingly, in the time frame of synaptic transmission, small base loads would generate relatively large changes in interstitial pH.},

On this small scale, however, classical principles of electrophysiology do not always apply. This is in large part because the nanoscopic heterogeneities in ionic concentrations and the local electric fields associated with individual ions and their movement can no longer be ignored. Here, we review basic principles of molecular electrodiffusion in the cellular environment of organized brain tissue. We argue that accurate interpretation of physiological observations on the nanoscale requires a better understanding of the underlying electrodiffusion phenomena.},

We seek to study these dynamics with respect to the following compartments: neurons, glia, and extracellular space. We are particularly interested in the slower time-scale dynamics that determine overall excitability, and set the stage for transient episodes of persistent oscillations, working memory, or seizures. In this second of two companion papers, we present an ionic current network model composed of populations of Hodgkin-Huxley type excitatory and inhibitory neurons embedded within extracellular space and glia, in order to investigate the role of micro-environmental ionic dynamics on the stability of persistent activity. We show that these networks reproduce seizure-like activity if glial cells fail to maintain the proper micro-environmental conditions surrounding neurons, and produce several experimentally testable predictions. Our work suggests that the stability of persistent states to perturbation is set by glial activity, and that how the response to such perturbations decays or grows may be a critical factor in a variety of disparate transient phenomena such as working memory, burst firing in neonatal brain or spinal cord, up states, seizures, and cortical oscillations.},

  Abstract                 = {Cerebral water accumulation was studied during induction of brain edema in dystrophin-null transgenic mice (mdx-betageo) and control mice. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic analyses of dystrophin-null brains revealed a dramatic reduction of AQP4 (aquaporin-4) in astroglial end-feet surrounding capillaries (blood-brain barrier) and at the glia limitans (cerebrospinal fluid-brain interface). The AQP4 protein is mislocalized, because immunoblotting showed that the total AQP4 protein abundance was unaltered. Brain edema was induced by i.p. injection of distilled water and 8-deamino-arginine vasopressin. Changes in cerebral water compartments were assessed by diffusion-weighted MRI with determination of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). In dystrophin-null mice and control mice, ADC gradually decreased by 5-6\% from baseline levels during the first 35 min, indicating the initial phase of intracellular water accumulation is similar in the two groups. At this point, the control mice sustained an abrupt, rapid decline in ADC to 58\% +/- 2.2\% of the baseline at 52.5 min, and all of the animals were dead by 56 min. After a consistent delay, the dystrophin-null mice sustained a similar decline in ADC to 55\% +/- 3.4\% at 66.5 min, when all of the mice were dead. These results demonstrate that dystrophin is necessary for polarized distribution of AQP4 protein in brain where facilitated movements of water occur across the blood-brain barrier and cerebrospinal fluid-brain interface. Moreover, these results predict that interference with the subcellular localization of AQP4 may have therapeutic potential for delaying the onset of impending brain edema.},

  Abstract                 = {The aquaporins (AQP) are a family of homologous water channels expressed in many epithelial and endothelial cell types involved in fluid transport. AQP1 protein is strongly expressed in most microvascular endothelia outside of the brain, as well as in endothelial cells in cornea, intestinal lacteals, and other tissues. AQP4 is expressed in astroglial foot processes adjacent to endothelial cells in the central nervous system. Transgenic mice lacking aquaporins have been useful in defining their role in mammalian physiology. Mice lacking AQP1 manifest defective urinary concentrating ability, in part because of decreased water permeability in renal vasa recta microvessels. These mice also show a defect in dietary fat processing that may involve chylomicron absorption by intestinal lacteals, as well as defective active fluid transport across the corneal endothelium. AQP1 might also play a role in tumour angiogenesis and in renal microvessel structural adaptation. However, AQP1 in most endothelial tissues does not appear to have a physiological function despite its role in osmotically driven water transport. For example, mice lacking AQP1 have low alveolar-capillary water permeability but unimpaired lung fluid absorption, as well as unimpaired saliva and tear secretion, aqueous fluid outflow, and pleural and peritoneal fluid transport. In the central nervous system mice lacking AQP4 are partially protected from brain oedema in water intoxication and ischaemic models of brain injury. Therefore, although the role of aquaporins in epithelial fluid transport is in most cases well-understood, there remain many questions about the role of aquaporins in endothelial cell function. It is unclear why many leaky microvessels strongly express AQP1 without apparent functional significance. Improved understanding of aquaporin-endothelial biology may lead to novel therapies for human disease, such as pharmacological modulation of corneal fluid transport, renal fluid clearance and intestinal absorption.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is expressed in astrocytes throughout the central nervous system, particularly at the blood-brain and brain-cerebrospinal fluid barriers. Phenotype analysis of transgenic mice lacking AQP4 has provided compelling evidence for involvement of AQP4 in cerebral water balance, astrocyte migration, and neural signal transduction. AQP4-null mice have reduced brain swelling and improved neurological outcome in models of (cellular) cytotoxic cerebral edema including water intoxication, focal cerebral ischemia, and bacterial meningitis. However, brain swelling and clinical outcome are worse in AQP4-null mice in models of vasogenic (fluid leak) edema including cortical freeze-injury, brain tumor, brain abscess and hydrocephalus, probably due to impaired AQP4-dependent brain water clearance. AQP4 deficiency or knock-down slows astrocyte migration in response to a chemotactic stimulus in vitro, and AQP4 deletion impairs glial scar progression following injury in vivo. AQP4-null mice also manifest reduced sound- and light-evoked potentials, and increased threshold and prolonged duration of induced seizures. Impaired K+ reuptake by astrocytes in AQP4 deficiency may account for the neural signal transduction phenotype. Based on these findings, we propose modulation of AQP4 expression or function as a novel therapeutic strategy for a variety of cerebral disorders including stroke, tumor, infection, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of high-throughput methods of molecular biology with advanced mathematical and computational techniques has propelled the emergent field of systems biology into a position of prominence. Unthinkable a decade ago, it has become possible to screen and analyze the expression of entire genomes, simultaneously assess large numbers of proteins and their prevalence, and characterize in detail the metabolic state of a cell population. Although very important, the focus on comprehensive networks of biological components is only one side of systems biology. Complementing large-scale assessments, and sometimes at the risk of being forgotten, are more subtle analyses that rationalize the design and functioning of biological modules in exquisite detail. This intricate side of systems biology aims at identifying the specific roles of processes and signals in smaller, fully regulated systems by computing what would happen if these signals were lacking or organized in a different fashion. We exemplify this type of approach with a detailed analysis of the regulation of glucose utilization in Lactococcus lactis. This organism is exposed to alternating periods of glucose availability and starvation. During starvation, it accumulates an intermediate of glycolysis, which allows it to take up glucose immediately upon availability. This notable accumulation poses a nontrivial control task that is solved with an unusual, yet ingeniously designed and timed feedforward activation system. The elucidation of this control system required high-precision, dynamic in vivo metabolite data, combined with methods of nonlinear systems analysis, and may serve as a paradigm for multidisciplinary approaches to fine-scaled systems biology.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytic gap junctions have been suggested to contribute to spatial buffering of potassium in the brain. Direct evidence has been difficult to gather because of the lack of astrocyte-specific gap junction blockers. We obtained mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes by crossing conditional connexin43-deficient mice with connexin30(-/-) mice. Similar to wild-type astrocytes, genetically uncoupled hippocampal astrocytes displayed negative resting membrane potentials, time- and voltage-independent whole-cell currents, and typical astrocyte morphologies. Astrocyte densities were also unchanged. Using potassium-selective microelectrodes, we assessed changes in potassium buffering in hippocampal slices of mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes. We demonstrate that astrocytic gap junctions accelerate potassium clearance, limit potassium accumulation during synchronized neuronal firing, and aid in radial potassium relocation in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. Furthermore, slices of mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes displayed a reduced threshold for the generation of epileptiform events. However, it was evident that radial relocation of potassium in the stratum radiatum was not dependent on gap junctional coupling. We suggest that the perpendicular array of individual astrocytes in the stratum radiatum makes these cells ideally suited for spatial buffering of potassium released by pyramidal cells, independent of gap junctions. In general, a surprisingly large capacity for K+ clearance was conserved in mice with coupling-deficient astrocytes, indicating that gap junction-dependent processes only partially account for K+ buffering in the hippocampus.},

Use of transgenic mice with hGFAP promoter-controlled EGFP expression and patch-clamp recordings allow reliable identification of the two cell types in hippocampal slices. Extending functional characterization, we report here the complete lack of gap junctional tracer coupling in GluR cells, while GluT cells are shown to be extensively coupled. This distinction is valid in immature as well as adult animals. Analysis of transgenic mice expressing beta-Gal under regulatory elements of the Cx43 promoter revealed the absence of Cx43 in GluR cells. Experiments using gap junction blockers demonstrated that passive currents, displayed primarily by GluT cells, do not reflect intercellular coupling but are attributable to intrinsic membrane properties of individual cells. This study supports the notion that the two subpopulations of hGFAP-EGFP-positive cells represent distinct cell types with contrasting physiological properties. Since GluR cells do not participate in the astrocytic gap junctional network, their functional role must be different from spatial buffering of ions or signaling molecules, i.e., properties generally assigned to astrocytes.},

There is a systematic description of the available evidence for astrocytic involvement in situ. The three possible astrocytic potassium clearance mechanisms are introduced: spatial buffer mechanism; carrier-operated potassium chloride uptake as well as channel-operated potassium chloride uptake. The three mechanisms are compared and their compatibility is discussed. Evidence is now available showing that at least two of these if not all three mechanisms co-exist and complement each other. Finally, it is concluded that these potassium movements are not used as a signal system, only as a homeostatic feedback mechanisms.

After several years of intense research since the pioneer discovery of astrocytic calcium waves and glutamate release onto neurons in vitro, the neuronal-glial studies have answered many questions thanks to technological advances. However, the definitive in vivo role of astrocytes remains to be addressed. In addition, it is becoming clear that diverse populations of astrocytes coexist with different molecular identities and specialized functions adjusted to their microenvironment, but do they all belong to the umbrella family of astrocytes? One population of astrocytes takes on a new function by displaying both support cell and stem cell characteristics in the neurogenic niches. Here, we define characteristics that classify a cell as an astrocyte under physiological conditions. We will also discuss the well-established and emerging functions of astrocytes with an emphasis on their roles on neuronal activity and as neural stem cells in adult neurogenic zones.},

and physiological differences between interneurons and the (relay)
cells that project to cortex are vast. To explore how these differences
might influence visual processing, we made intracellular recordings
from both classes of cells in vivo in cats. Macroscopically, all
receptive fields were similar, consisting of two concentrically arranged
subregions in which dark and bright stimuli elicited responses of
the reverse sign. Microscopically, however, the responses of the
two types of cells had opposite profiles. Excitatory stimuli drove
trains of single excitatory postsynaptic potentials in relay cells,
but graded depolarizations in interneurons. Conversely, suppressive
stimuli evoked smooth hyperpolarizations in relay cells and unitary
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in interneurons. Computational
analyses suggested that these complementary patterns of response
help to preserve information encoded in the fine timing of retinal
spikes and to increase the amount of information transmitted to cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {The rat proximal tubule epithelium is represented as well-stirred, compliant cellular and paracellular compartments bounded by mucosal and serosal bathing solutions. With a uniform pCO2 throughout the epithelium, the model variables include the concentrations of Na, K, Cl, HCO3, H2PO4, HPO4, and H, as well as hydrostatic pressure and electrical potential. Except for a metabolically driven Na-K exchanger at the basolateral cell membrane, all membrane transport within the epithelium is passive and is represented by the linear equations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. In particular, this includes the cotransport of Na-Cl and Na-H2PO4 and countertransport of Na-H at the apical cell membrane. Experimental constraints on the choice of ionic conductivities are satisfied by allowing K-Cl cotransport at the basolateral membrane. The model equations include those for mass balance of the nonreacting species, as well as chemical equilibrium for the acidification reactions. Time-dependent terms are retained to permit the study of transient phenomena. In the steady state the energy dissipation is computed and verified equal to the sum of input from the Na-K exchanger plus the Gibbs free energy of mass addition to the system. The parameter dependence of coupled water transport is studied and shown to be consistent with the predictions of previous analytical models of the lateral intercellular space. Water transport in the presence of an end-proximal (HCO3-depleted) luminal solution is investigated. Here the lower permeability and higher reflection coefficient of HCO3 enhance net sodium and water transport. Due to enhanced flux across the tight junction, this process may permit proximal tubule Na transport to proceed with diminished energy dissipation.},

  Abstract                 = {The regenerative capacity of the CNS is extremely limited. The reason for this is unclear, but glial cell involvement has been suspected, and oligodendrocytes have been implicated as inhibitors of neuroregeneration (Chen et al., 2000, GrandPre et al., 2000; Fournier et al., 2001). The role of astrocytes in this process was proposed but remains incompletely understood (Silver and Miller, 2004). Astrocyte activation (reactive gliosis) accompanies neurotrauma, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, or tumors. Two prominent hallmarks of reactive gliosis are hypertrophy of astrocytic processes and upregulation of intermediate filaments. Using the entorhinal cortex lesion model in mice, we found that reactive astrocytes devoid of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin (GFAP-/-Vim-/-), and consequently lacking intermediate filaments (Colucci-Guyon et al., 1994; Pekny et al., 1995; Eliasson et al., 1999), showed only a limited hypertrophy of cell processes. Instead, many processes were shorter and not straight, albeit the volume of neuropil reached by a single astrocyte was the same as in wild-type mice. This was accompanied by remarkable synaptic regeneration in the hippocampus. On a molecular level, GFAP-/-Vim-/- reactive astrocytes could not upregulate endothelin B receptors, suggesting that the upregulation is intermediate filament dependent. These findings show a novel role for intermediate filaments in astrocytes and implicate reactive astrocytes as potent inhibitors of neuroregeneration.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To determine the effect of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL)-induced abolition of potassium siphoning by the vitreal end feet of Miller cells.

METHODS: Porcine eyecups were filled with stained balanced salt solution and PFCLs (perfluorodecalin, perfluorooctane, perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene or the semifluorocarbon perfluorohexylhexane). With optical coherence tomography, the distance between PFCL and retina was determined, and the size of the aqueous space covering the retinal surface was estimated. The data were used to calculate the retinal potassium siphoning into small aqueous volumes.

RESULTS: The distance between PFCL and retinal surface was found to be less than 5 to 10 microm with any PFCL tested. The resultant volume of the aqueous space was too small to act as a sufficient sink for K+ ion siphoning.

CONCLUSIONS: A certain threshold volume of vitreal fluid seems to be necessary for efficient buffering of intraretinal increases of K+ and perhaps other (e.g., H+) ions through the M\"{u}ller cells. When the aqueous fluid is replaced by a PFCL (or by silicone oil) for longer periods, the outer retina becomes subject to long-lasting K+ accumulation, and consequent neurodegeneration and reactive gliosis occurs. The authors propose to search for new vitreous-substituting fluids with the capability to dissolve ions.},

  Abstract                 = {Astrocytes are critical regulators of neural and neurovascular network communication. Potassium transport is a central mechanism behind their many functions. Astrocytes encircle synapses with their distal processes, which express two potassium pumps (Na-K and NKCC) and an inward rectifying potassium channel (Kir), whereas the vessel-adjacent endfeet express Kir and BK potassium channels. We provide a detailed model of potassium flow throughout the neurovascular unit (synaptic region, astrocytes, and arteriole) for the cortex of the young brain. Our model reproduces several phenomena observed experimentally: functional hyperemia, in which neural activity triggers astrocytic potassium release at the perivascular endfoot, inducing arteriole dilation; K(+) undershoot in the synaptic space after periods of neural activity; neurally induced astrocyte hyperpolarization during Kir blockade. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the vascular response during functional hyperemia are governed by astrocytic Kir for the fast onset and astrocytic BK for maintaining dilation. The model supports the hypothesis that K(+) undershoot is caused by excessive astrocytic uptake through Na-K and NKCC pumps, whereas the effect is balanced by Kir. We address parametric uncertainty using high-dimensional stochastic sensitivity analysis and identify possible model limitations.},

The core of the ion channel shares structural features with an inverted K(+) channel. In detail, however, differences are emerging. Most notable in the glutamate receptor ion channel are distinct structural and functional properties of a major pore-lining domain, the requirement of an additional transmembrane segment (M4), and twofold rather than fourfold symmetry. Together with ligand-binding domain structures and kinetic experiments, these findings have started to define the basic principles of channel gating in glutamate receptors.},

However, ex vivo stimulation of muscle for as little as 18 contractions (1 min, 0.3 Hz) dramatically increased the activity of the cotransporter, measured as the bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb influx, in both soleus and plantaris muscles. This activation of cotransporter activity remained relatively constant for up to 10-Hz stimulation for 1 min, falling off at higher frequencies (30-Hz stimulation for 1 min). Similarly, stimulation of skeletal muscle with adrenergic receptor agonists phenylephrine, isoproterenol, or epinephrine produced a dramatic stimulation of NKCC activity. It did not appear that stimulation of NKCC activity was a reflection of increased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity because insulin treatment did not stimulate NKCC activity, despite insulin's well-known stimulation of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. Stimulation of NKCC activity could be blocked by pretreatment with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) activity, indicating that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) MAPKs may be required. These data indicate a regulated NKCC activity in skeletal muscle that may provide a significant pathway for potassium transport into skeletal muscle fibers.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of mechanisms have been proposed to play a role in the regulation of activity-dependent variations in extracellular potassium concentration ([K(+)](o)). We tested possible regulatory mechanisms for [K(+)](o) during spontaneous recurrent epileptiform activity induced in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal slices from adult rats by perfusion with 8 mM potassium and 0-added calcium medium in an interface chamber. Local application of tetrodotoxin blocked local [K(+)](o) changes, suggesting that potassium is released and taken up locally. Perfusion with barium or cesium, blockers of the inward rectifying potassium channel, did not alter the baseline [K(+)](o), the ceiling level of [K(+)](o) reached during the burst, or the rate of [K(+)](o) recovery after termination of the bursts. Decreasing gap junctional conductance did not change the baseline [K(+)](o) or the half-time of recovery of the [K(+)](o) after the bursts but did cause a decrease in the ceiling level of [K(+)](o). Perfusion with furosemide, which will block cation/chloride cotransporters, or perfusion with low chloride did not change the baseline [K(+)](o) or the half-time of recovery of the [K(+)](o) after the bursts but did increase the ceiling level of [K(+)](o). Bath or local application of ouabain, a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor, increased the baseline [K(+)](o), slowed the rate of [K(+)](o) recovery, and induced spreading depression. These findings suggest that potassium redistribution by glia only plays a minor role in the regulation of [K(+)](o) in this model. The major regulator of [K(+)](o) in this model appears to be uptake via a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, most likely neuronal.},

  Abstract                 = {Glial cells are believed to play a major role in the regulation of the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o), particularly when the [K+]o is increased. Using ion-selective electrodes, we compared the [K+]o changes in the dentate gyrus of urethane-anaesthetized adult rats in the presence of reactive astrocytes and after reduction of glial function. The regulation of [K+]o in the dentate gyrus was determined by measuring the ceiling level of [K+]o and the half-time of recovery of [K+]o during and after seizures produced by 20 Hz trains of stimulation to the angular bundle. Reactive astrocytes were induced by repeated seizures and their presence was confirmed by a qualitative increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin immunoreactivity. To inhibit glial function, fluorocitrate (FC), a reversible metabolic inhibitor, or alpha-aminoadipate (alpha-AA), an irreversible toxin, was injected into the dentate gyrus region, and the regulation of [K+]o was monitored for 8 h or 2 days later, respectively. After alpha-aminoadipate, loss of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus was demonstrated by loss of staining for GFAP. In the presence of reactive astrocytes there was no significant change in the peak [K+]o during seizures or the half-time of recovery of [K+]o after seizures compared to control animals. alpha-Aminoadipate significantly slowed the rate of recovery of [K+]o, but did not change the ceiling [K+]o. Fluorocitrate reversibly decreased the ceiling [K+]o, but also slowed the rate of recovery of [K+]o. Overall our results suggest that normal glial function is required for the recovery of elevated [K+]o after seizures in vivo.},

In astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we previously detected AQP3, 5 and 8 mRNAs in addition to the reported AQP4 and 9. However the mechanisms regulating the expression of these AQPs are not known. In this study, we investigated the effects of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator on the expression of AQP4, 5 and 9 in cultured rat astrocytes. Treatment of the cells with TPA caused decreases in AQP4 and 9 mRNAs and proteins in time- and concentration-dependent manners. The TPA-induced decreases in AQP4 and 9 mRNAs were inhibited by PKC inhibitors. Moreover, prolonged treatment of the cells with TPA eliminated the subsequent decreases in AQP4 and 9 mRNAs caused by TPA. Pretreatment of cells with an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, did not inhibit the decreases in AQP4 and 9 mRNAs induced by TPA. These results suggest that signal transduction via PKC may play important roles in regulating the expression of AQP4 and 9.},

  Abstract                 = {Our previous study demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) during ischemia and reperfusion attenuated neuronal damage and edema. In this study, we further investigated whether NKCC1 activity contributes to ischemic damage during either ischemia or reperfusion. Immunoblotting revealed that expression of NKCC1 protein was increased following 2-h focal ischemia in cerebral cortex. A sustained up-regulation of NKCC1 in cortex was detected at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h of reperfusion. An increase in the phosphorylated NKCC1 (NKCC1-p) was found at 4 and 8 h of reperfusion. In striatum, a significant increase in NKCC1 expression occurred between 4 and 24 h of reperfusion and no elevation of NKCC1-p signal was observed. Artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) or 100 microM bumetanide in aCSF were continuously microdialyzed into left cortices either 1 h prior to ischemia plus 2-h ischemia, or only during 24-h reperfusion. Infarction volume was significantly decreased in the pre-ischemic bumetanide-treated group (P<0.05) but not in the post-ischemic treatment group (P>0.05). In addition, pre-ischemic bumetanide treatment reduced the ipsilateral water content increase by 70\% (P<0.05). Inhibition of NKCC1 did not attenuate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage or the number of TUNEL-labeled apoptotic cells in ischemic brains. These results suggest that inhibition of NKCC1 attenuates cytotoxic edema and necrotic neuronal death during focal ischemia. Activation of NKCC1 activity plays a role in the early stage of ischemic damage.},

  Abstract                 = {Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter has been proposed to play an important role in the regulation of intracellular Cl(-) concentration in neurons during development. In this study, the expression pattern of the cotransporter in different regions of rat brain was examined at birth (P0), postnatal days 7 (P7), P14, P21, and adult by Western blotting analysis. In cortex, thalamus, cerebellum and striatum, the cotransporter expression level was low at P0 and significantly increased at P14 (P<0.05). The expression peaked at P21 and was maintained at the same level in adulthood. However, in hippocampus, a peak level of the cotransporter expression was detected in adult brain. The immunocytochemistry study of adult rat brain revealed that an intense staining of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter protein was observed in dendritic processes of CA1-CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In contrast, abundant immuno-reactive signals of the cotransporter were found in somata of thalamic nucleus. Immunofluorescence double staining demonstrates that the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter was expressed in astrocytes within cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, co-localization of the cotransporter and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or with aquaporin 4, was found in perivascular astrocytes of cortical cortex and white matter. The results indicate that a time-dependent expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter protein occurs not only in cortex but also in hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum. In addition, the cotransporter is expressed in astrocytes and perivascular astrocytes of adult rat brain.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this study was to compare single channel water and glycerol permeabilities of mammalian aquaporins (AQP) 1-5 and the major intrinsic protein of lens fiber (MIP). Each of the six cloned cDNAs from rat was left untagged or was epitope-tagged with c-Myc or FLAG at either the N or C terminus so that results would not depend on epitope identity or location. The constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for measurement of osmotic water permeability (Pf), [3H]glycerol uptake, and protein expression. Each of the 30 epitope-tagged constructs was expressed strongly at the oocyte plasma membrane. The 10-min uptake of [3H]glycerol was increased significantly (range of 4.5-8-fold over control) in oocytes expressing untagged AQP3 (GLIP) and each of the four tagged AQP3 constructs; [3H]glycerol uptake was not increased in oocytes expressing AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, AQP5, or MIP. In oocytes microinjected with 5 ng of cRNA, average Pf values (in cm/s x 10(-3)) were 0.67 +/- 0.06 (control), 19 +/- 2 (AQP1), 10 +/- 1 (AQP2), 8 +/- 2 (AQP3), 29 +/- 1 (AQP4), 10 +/- 1 (AQP5), and 1.3 +/- 0.2 (MIP), and they were relatively insensitive to the presence, identity, or location of the epitope tag. Pf values were not affected by protein kinase A or C activation. After normalization for plasma membrane expression by immunoprecipitation of microdissected plasma membranes, single channel water permeabilities (pf, referenced to the AQP1 pf of 6 x 10(-14) cm3/s) were (in cm3/s x 10(-14)) 3.3 +/- 0.2 (AQP2), 2.1 +/- 0.3 (AQP3), 24 +/- 0.6 (AQP4), 5.0 +/- 0.4 (AQP5), and 0.25 +/- 0.05 (MIP); pf values were insensitive to epitope identity and location. These results indicate very different intrinsic water permeabilities for the mammalian aquaporin homologs, with the pf value for AQP4 remarkably higher than those for the others. The pf values establish limits on aquaporin tissue densities required for physiological function and suggest significant structural and functional differences among the aquaporins.},

  Abstract                 = {CO2 chemoreception may be related to modulation of inward rectifier K+ channels (Kir channels) in brainstem neurons. Kir4.1 is expressed predominantly in the brainstem and inhibited during hypercapnia. Although the homomeric Kir4.1 only responds to severe intracellular acidification, coexpression of Kir4.1 with Kir5.1 greatly enhances channel sensitivities to CO2 and pH. To understand the biophysical and molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of these currents by CO2 and pH, heteromeric Kir4. 1-Kir5.1 were studied in inside-out patches. These Kir4.1-Kir5.1 currents showed a single channel conductance of 59 pS with open-state probability (P(open)) approximately 0.4 at pH 7.4. Channel activity reached the maximum at pH 8.5 and was completely suppressed at pH 6.5 with pKa 7.45. The effect of low pH on these currents was due to selective suppression of P(open) without evident effects on single channel conductance, leading to a decrease in the channel mean open time and an increase in the mean closed time. At pH 8.5, single-channel currents showed two sublevels of conductance at approximately 1/4 and 3/4 of the maximal openings. None of them was affected by lowering pH. The Kir4.1-Kir5.1 currents were modulated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) that enhanced baseline P(open) and reduced channel sensitivity to intracellular protons. In the presence of 10 microM PIP2, the Kir4.1-Kir5.1 showed a pKa value of 7.22. The effect of PIP2, however, was not seen in homomeric Kir4.1 currents. The CO2/pH sensitivities were related to a lysine residue in the NH2 terminus of Kir4.1. Mutation of this residue (K67M, K67Q) completely eliminated the CO2 sensitivity of both homomeric Kir4.1 and heteromeric Kir4.1-Kir5.1. In excised patches, interestingly, the Kir4.1-Kir5.1 carrying K67M mutation remained sensitive to low pHi. Such pH sensitivity, however, disappeared in the presence of PIP2. The effect of PIP2 on shifting the titration curve of wild-type and mutant channels was totally abolished when Arg178 in Kir5.1 was mutated. Thus, these studies demonstrate a heteromeric Kir channel that can be modulated by both acidic and alkaline pH, show the modulation of pH sensitivity of Kir channels by PIP2, and provide information of the biophysical and molecular mechanisms underlying the Kir modulation by intracellular protons.},

  Abstract                 = {A model of the sarcomeric control of contraction at various loading conditions has to maintain three cardinal features: stability, controllability (where the output can be controlled by the input), and observability (where the output reflects the effects of all the state variables). The suggested model of the sarcomere couples calcium kinetics with cross-bridge (XB) cycling and comprises two feedback mechanisms: (i) the cooperativity, whereby the number of force-generating (strong) XBs determines calcium affinity, regulates XB recruitment, and (ii) the mechanical feedback, whereby shortening velocity determines XBs cycling rate, controls the XBs contractile efficiency. The sarcomere is described by a set of four first-order nonlinear differential equations, utilizing the Matlab's Simulink software. Small oscillatory input was imposed when the state variables trajectories reached a steady state. The linearized state-space representations of the model were calculated for various initial sarcomere lengths. The analysis of the state-space representation validates the controllability and observability of the model. The model has four poles: three at the left side of the complex plane and one integrating pole at the origin. Therefore, the system is marginally stable. The Laplace transform confirms that the state representation is minimal and is therefore observable and controllable. The extension of the model to a multi-sarcomere lattice was explored, and the effects of inhomogeneity and nonuniform activation were described.},

  Abstract                 = {Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse the concentrative uptake of glutamate from the synapse to intracellular spaces by harnessing pre-existing ion gradients. In the central nervous system glutamate transporters are essential for normal development and function, and are implicated in stroke, epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present the crystal structure of a eukaryotic glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii. The transporter is a bowl-shaped trimer with a solvent-filled extracellular basin extending halfway across the membrane bilayer. At the bottom of the basin are three independent binding sites, each cradled by two helical hairpins, reaching from opposite sides of the membrane. We propose that transport of glutamate is achieved by movements of the hairpins that allow alternating access to either side of the membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {The relation between substrate and water transport was studied in Na+-coupled cotransporters of glucose (SGLT1) and of iodide (NIS) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The water transport was monitored from changes in oocyte volume at a resolution of 20 pl, more than one order of magnitude better than previous investigations. The rate of cotransport was monitored as the clamp current obtained from two-electrode voltage clamp. The high resolution data demonstrated a fixed ratio between the turn-over of the cotransporter and the rate of water transport. This applied to experiments in which the rate of cotransport was changed by isosmotic application of substrate, by rapid changes in clamp voltage, or by poisoning. Transport of larger substrates gave rise to less water transport. For the rabbit SGLT1, 378+/-20 (n=18 oocytes) water molecules were cotransported along with the 2 Na+ ions and the glucose-analogue alpha-MDG (MW 194); using the larger sugar arbutin (MW 272) this number was reduced by a factor of at least 0.86+/-0.03 (15). For the human SGLT1 the respective numbers were 234+/-12 (18) and 0.85+/-0.8 (7). For NIS, 253+/-16 (12) water molecules were cotransported for each 2 Na+ and 1 thiocyanate (SCN-, MW 58), with I- as anion (MW 127) only 162+/-11 (19) water molecules were cotransported. The effect of substrate size suggests a molecular mechanism for water cotransport and is opposite to what would be expected from unstirred layer effects. Data were analysed by a model which combined cotransport and osmosis at the membrane with diffusion in the cytoplasm. The combination of high resolution measurements and precise modelling showed that water transport across the membrane can be explained by cotransport of water in the membrane proteins and that intracellular unstirred layers effects are minute.},

abstract = {Inhibitory interneurons (INs) in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) provide both axonal and dendritic GABA output to thalamocortical relay cells (TCs). Distal parts of the IN dendrites often enter into complex arrangements known as triadic synapses, where the IN dendrite plays a dual role as postsynaptic to retinal input and presynaptic to TC dendrites. Dendritic GABA release can be triggered by retinal input, in a highly localized process that is functionally isolated from the soma, but can also be triggered by somatically elicited Ca(2+)-spikes and possibly by backpropagating action potentials. Ca(2+)-spikes in INs are predominantly mediated by T-type Ca(2+)-channels (T-channels). Due to the complex nature of the dendritic signalling, the function of the IN is likely to depend critically on how T-channels are distributed over the somatodendritic membrane (T-distribution). To study the relationship between the T-distribution and several IN response properties, we here run a series of simulations where we vary the T-distribution in a multicompartmental IN model with a realistic morphology. We find that the somatic response to somatic current injection is facilitated by a high T-channel density in the soma-region. Conversely, a high T-channel density in the distal dendritic region is found to facilitate dendritic signalling in both the outward direction (increases the response in distal dendrites to somatic input) and the inward direction (the soma responds stronger to distal synaptic input). The real T-distribution is likely to reflect a compromise between several neural functions, involving somatic response patterns and dendritic signalling.},

abstract = {The recent development of large multielectrode recording arrays has made it affordable for an increasing number of laboratories to record from multiple brain regions simultaneously. The development of analytical tools for array data, however, lags behind these technological advances in hardware. In this paper, we present a method based on forward modeling for estimating current source density from electrophysiological signals recorded on a two-dimensional grid using multi-electrode rectangular arrays. This new method, which we call two-dimensional inverse Current Source Density (iCSD 2D), is based upon and extends our previous one- and three-dimensional techniques. We test several variants of our method, both on surrogate data generated from a collection of Gaussian sources, and on model data from a population of layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons. We also apply the method to experimental data from the rat subiculum. The main advantages of the proposed method are the explicit specification of its assumptions, the possibility to include system-specific information as it becomes available, the ability to estimate CSD at the grid boundaries, and lower reconstruction errors when compared to the traditional approach. These features make iCSD 2D a substantial improvement over the approaches used so far and a powerful new tool for the analysis of multielectrode array data. We also provide a free GUI-based MATLAB toolbox to analyze and visualize our test data as well as user datasets.},

abstract = {The myocardial ischemic border zone is associated with the initiation and sustenance of arrhythmias. The profile of ionic concentrations across the border zone play a significant role in determining cellular electrophysiology and conductivity, yet their spatial-temporal evolution and regulation are not well understood. To investigate the changes in ion concentrations that regulate cellular electrophysiology, a mathematical model of ion movement in the intra and extracellular space in the presence of ionic, potential and material property heterogeneities was developed. The model simulates the spatial and temporal evolution of concentrations of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, hydrogen and bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide across an ischemic border zone. Ischemia was simulated by sodium-potassium pump inhibition, potassium channel activation and respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The model predicted significant disparities in the width of the border zone for each ionic species, with intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium having discordant gradients, facilitating multiple gradients in cellular properties across the border zone. Extracellular potassium was found to have the largest border zone and this was attributed to the voltage dependence of the potassium channels. The model also predicted the efflux of [Formula: see text] from the ischemic region due to electrogenic drift and diffusion within the intra and extracellular space, respectively, which contributed to [Formula: see text] depletion in the ischemic region.},

In order to correctly interpret such electrophysiological data, it is vital to adequately understand the electrical properties of neural tissue itself. An ongoing controversy in the field of neuroscience is whether such frequency-dependent effects bias LFP recordings and affect the proper interpretation of the signal. On macroscopic scales and with large injected currents, previous studies have found various grades of frequency dependence of cortical tissue, ranging from negligible to strong, within the frequency band typically considered relevant for neuroscience (less than a few thousand hertz). Here, we performed a detailed investigation of the frequency dependence of the conductivity within cortical tissue at microscopic distances using small current amplitudes within the typical (neuro)physiological micrometer and sub-nanoampere range. We investigated the propagation of LFPs, induced by extracellular electrical current injections via patch-pipettes, in acute rat brain slice preparations containing the somatosensory cortex in vitro using multielectrode arrays. Based on our data, we determined the cortical tissue conductivity over a 100-fold increase in signal frequency (5{\textendash}500 Hz). Our results imply at most very weak frequency-dependent effects within the frequency range of physiological LFPs. Using biophysical modeling, we estimated the impact of different putative impedance spectra. Our results indicate that frequency dependencies of the order measured here and in most other studies have negligible impact on the typical analysis and modeling of LFP signals from extracellular brain recordings.},

abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal
ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560
multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and
a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids
(with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing
behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with
basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial
and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons,
which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could
have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed
either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical
dendrites; thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis
(nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic
connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary
choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by
AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABA(A) receptors), we also included electrical
coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells,
and--in various combinations--electrical coupling between the proximal
axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates
several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma
oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized
population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated
double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations
({\textgreater}100 Hz, "VFO"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about
10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple
bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in
the presence of kainate, when both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors
are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary
(as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays

@article{Buccino2018,
abstract = {Neural circuits typically consist of many different types of neurons, and one faces the challenge to disentangle their individual contributions in measured neural activity. Classification of cells into inhibitory and excitatory neurons, and localization of neurons based on extracellular recordings are frequently employed procedures. Current approaches, however, need a lot of human intervention, which makes them slow, biased, and unreliable. Based on recent advances in deep learning techniques and exploiting the availability of neuron models with quasi-realistic 3D morphology and physiological properties, we present a framework for automatized and objective classification and localization of cells based on the spatiotemporal profiles of the extracellular action potential recorded by multi-electrode arrays. We train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on simulated signals from a large set of cell models, and show that our framework can predict the position of neurons with high accuracy, more precisely than current state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also able to classify whether a neuron is excitatory or inhibitory with very high accuracy, substantially improving on commonly used clustering techniques. Furthermore, our new method seems to have the potential to separate certain subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The possibility to automatically localize and classify all neurons recorded with large high-density extracellular electrodes contributes to a more accurate and more reliable mapping of neural circuits.},

@article{DelgadoRuz2014,
abstract = {Neuronal microcircuits are formed of a myriad of spatially and functionally specific cell classes. Despite the importance of the spatial component in the characterisation of neural circuits, it has not received the attention it deserves. While multi-electrodes are widely used in the study of microcircuits, the spatial information available from them remains largely unexploited for analysis beyond spike sorting. Here we show how the spatial pattern of the extracellular signal is determined by both the electrophysiology and morphology of neurons. Starting from known current source models for the generation of the extracellular potential, we use the spatial pattern observed across a multi-electrode array to localise and classify neurons into putative morphological classes. We evaluated the localisation and classification models with low fitting errors in simulated data. When applying them to recorded data we found correspondence between localisation statistics and expected recording radius and found evidence to support the separation into putative morphological classes. While existing localisation methods do not hold for the recording distances expected on multi-electrode recordings (under 60. $\mu$m), classification methods have been limited to the temporal component by either characterising spike shape or firing patterns. We show here how the information available from extracellular recordings can be used to localise and classify neurons based on the spatial pattern seen by multi-electrode arrays. Together they can improve current characterisation and classification of neurons based on complementary criteria such us firing pattern and functional characterisation. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Large amplitude activity with maximum power between 15 and 30 c/sec can be often observed on the subdural electrodes together with smaller amplitude lower frequencies, whereas on the scalp only a small part of this high frequency activity is seen and the lower frequencies dominate. The impedance between cortex and scalp has been shown to be similar for low and high EEG frequencies and the high attenuation of the ?? activity at scalp electrodes is believed to be due to summation of polyphasic cortical activity across a limited cortical area (spatial average) is similar to the activity of a non-recursive filter between cortex and scalp and has a low pass characteristic. ?? 1975.},

abstract = {Standard bioelectric field models assume that the tissue is purely resistive and frequency independent, and that capacitance, induction, and propagation effects can be neglected. However, real tissue properties are frequency dependent, and tissue capacitance can be important for problems involving short stimulation pulses. A straightforward interpolation scheme is introduced here that can account for frequency-dependent effects, while reducing runtime over a direct computation by several orders of magnitude. The exact Helmholtz solution is compared to several approximate field solutions and is used to study neural stimulation. Results show that frequency-independent tissue capacitance always acts to attenuate the stimulation pulse, thereby increasing firing thresholds, while the dispersion effects introduced by frequency-dependent capacitance may decrease firing thresholds.},

@article{Telenczuk2016,
abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) is generated by large populations of neurons, but unitary contribution of spiking neurons to LFP is not well characterized. We investigated this contribution in multi-electrode array recordings from the cerebral cortex of human and monkey by calculating the spike-triggered LFP average (st-LFP). The resulting st-LFPs were dominated by broad spatio-temporal components due to on-going activity, synaptic inputs and recurrent connectivity. To observe the local field of a single spike we applied spatial filtering. The filtered st-LFPs were limited to an area of 800 $\mu$m from the neuron, and propagated at axonal speed, which is consistent with their unitary nature. In addition, we discriminated between putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons and found that the former dominated this unitary LFP contribution, consistently with previous findings in hippocampal slices. Thus, in human and monkey cortex, the LFP may primarily reflect inhibitory neuron activity.},

The characterization of electrical properties of brain tissue has guided our fundamental understanding and application of these methods, from electrophysiologic theory to clinical dosing-metrics. Nonetheless, prior computational models have primarily relied on ex-vivo impedance measurements. We recorded the in-vivo impedances of brain tissues during neurosurgical procedures and used these results to construct MRI guided computational models of TMS and DBS neurostimulatory fields and conductance-based models of neurons exposed to stimulation. We demonstrated that tissues carry neurostimulation currents through frequency dependent resistive and capacitive properties not typically accounted for by past neurostimulation modeling work. We show that these fundamental brain tissue properties can have significant effects on the neurostimulatory-fields (capacitive and resistive current composition and spatial/temporal dynamics) and neural responses (stimulation threshold, ionic currents, and membrane dynamics). These findings highlight the importance of tissue impedance properties on neurostimulation and impact our understanding of the biological mechanisms and technological potential of neurostimulatory methods.},

abstract = {In rabbits anesthetized with urethane, cortical impedance was measured by applying nonstimulating sinusoidal currents through a 20-[mu] platinum electrode. Voltage was recorded differentially from two similar electrodes. All three electrodes were within 1 mm of each other. The animal was grounded through a current-monitoring resistor. The EEG was monitored throughout the experiment. The frequency response of the system was flat from 0 to better than 100 kc/sec. A subsidiary experiment which measured the voltage changes in all directions from a 20-[mu] current source on the cortical surface showed that hemispherical symmetry was true out to 1.3 mm from the current source. The effect of current shunting by pial blood vessels was also determined. Plotted in polar form, the impedance locus was noncircular and left the real axis at 356 ohm-cm at 10 to 20 cycle/sec, had a maximum phase shift of ca 7[degree sign] at 50 to 100 cycle/sec, and completed the loop at ca 5000 cycle/sec at 256 ohm-cm. At 20,000 to 50,000 cycle/sec another loop started to open. Nothing resembling an inductive component was seen.},

Such data will not only be invaluable for finding out how neural networks in the brain work, but will likely be important also for neural prosthesis applications. This opportunity can only be realized if efficient, accurate and validated methods for automatic spike sorting are provided. In this review we describe some of the challenges that must be met to achieve this goal, and in particular argue for the critical need of realistic model data to be used as ground truth in the validation of spike-sorting algorithms.},

  abstract        = {The analysis of multi-unit extracellular recordings of brain activity has led to the development of numerous tools, ranging from signal processing algorithms to electronic devices and applications. Currently, the evaluation and optimisation of these tools are hampered by the lack of ground-truth databases of neural signals. These databases must be parameterisable, easy to generate and bio-inspired, i.e. containing features encountered in real electrophysiological recording sessions. Towards that end, this article introduces an original computational approach to create fully annotated and parameterised benchmark datasets, generated from the summation of three components: neural signals from compartmental models and recorded extracellular spikes, non-stationary slow oscillations, and a variety of different types of artefacts. We present three application examples. (1) We reproduced in-vivo extracellular hippocampal multi-unit recordings from either tetrode or polytrode designs. (2) We simulated recordings in two different experimental conditions: anaesthetised and awake subjects. (3) Last, we also conducted a series of simulations to study the impact of different level of artefacts on extracellular recordings and their influence in the frequency domain. Beyond the results presented here, such a benchmark dataset generator has many applications such as calibration, evaluation and development of both hardware and software architectures.},
