  abstract        = {When recording neural activity from extracellular electrodes, both in vivo and in vitro, spike sorting is a required and very important processing step that allows for identification of single neurons' activity. Spike sorting is a complex algorithmic procedure, and in recent years many groups have attempted to tackle this problem, resulting in numerous methods and software packages. However, validation of spike sorting techniques is complicated. It is an inherently unsupervised problem and it is hard to find universal metrics to evaluate performance. Simultaneous recordings that combine extracellular and patch-clamp or juxtacellular techniques can provide ground-truth data to evaluate spike sorting methods. However, their utility is limited by the fact that only a few cells can be measured at the same time. Simulated ground-truth recordings can provide a powerful alternative mean to rank the performance of spike sorters. We present here MEArec, a Python-based software which permits flexible and fast simulation of extracellular recordings. MEArec allows users to generate extracellular signals on various customizable electrode designs and can replicate various problematic aspects for spike sorting, such as bursting, spatio-temporal overlapping events, and drifts. We expect MEArec will provide a common testbench for spike sorting development and evaluation, in which spike sorting developers can rapidly generate and evaluate the performance of their algorithms.},

Neuronal firing was related to the ongoing behavior of the rat. In addition, using a 16-channel neocortical recording/mapping system, we studied the effects of ibotenic acid lesion of NB, RT, and other thalamic nuclei on the patterns and spatial distribution of neocortical electrical activity. The majority of neurons in neocortex, NB, and RT increased their firing rates during walking, as compared to during immobility, with concurrent decrease of delta power in the neocortical EEG. During immobility, high-voltage spindles (HVS; greater than 1 mV) were occasionally recorded from the neocortex. Depth profiles of HVS and slow delta waves were different in the neocortex. Neocortical cells decreased their discharge frequency during the positive portion of delta waves recorded in layers V and VI. All cells in the neocortex and specific thalamic nuclei fired rhythmically and phase-locked to the spike component of HVS. RT neurons showed an opposite phase relationship and fired mainly during the wave component of HVS. Half of the NB neurons also showed phasic modulation with HVS. Circumscribed lesion of RT and extensive damage of other thalamic regions, including the intralaminar nuclei, suppressed HVS but had no effect on the neocortical EEG correlates of behavior. In sharp contrast, damage to the NB resulted in a dramatic increase of slow delta waves on the side of the lesion, mimicking the effect of scopolamine administration. We suggest that the NB plays a key role in neocortical arousal by directly activating the neocortex and by suppressing the rhythm generation in the RT-thalamocortical circuitry. We further suggest that the NB system may serve as a structural basis for the concept of the generalized ascending activation of Moruzzi and Magoun (1949).},

We ask whether constraining a model to fit the EAP is superior to matching the intracellular action potential (IAP). In agreement with previous studies, we find that the IAP method under-constrains the parameters. As a result, significantly different sets of parameters can have virtually identical IAP's. In contrast, the EAP method results in a much tighter constraint. We find that the distinguishing characteristics of the waveform--but not its amplitude-resulting from the distribution of active conductances are fairly invariant to changes of electrode position and detailed cellular morphology. Based on these results, we conclude that EAP recordings are an excellent source of data for the purpose of constraining compartmental models.},

APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at the onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature [the extracellular AP (EAP)] generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. The soma-dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potentials recorded in the brain.},

Both position and length of the AIS vary across and within neuron types, with activity, development and pathology. What is the impact of AIS geometry on excitability? Direct empirical assessment has proven difficult because of the many potential confounding factors. Here, we carried a principled theoretical analysis to answer this question. We provide a simple formula relating AIS geometry and sodium conductance density to the somatic voltage threshold. A distal shift of the AIS normally produces a (modest) increase in excitability, but we explain how this pattern can reverse if a hyperpolarizing current is present at the AIS, due to resistive coupling with the soma. This work provides a theoretical tool to assess the significance of structural AIS plasticity for electrical function.},

Recent experimental findings increasingly evidence that the axonal function is not limited to the simple transmission of APs. Advances in subcellular-resolution recording techniques have shown that axons display activity-dependent modulation in spike shape and conduction velocity, which influence synaptic strength and latency. We briefly review here, how recent methodological developments facilitate the understanding of the axon physiology. We included the three most common methods, i.e., genetically encoded voltage imaging (GEVI), subcellular patch-clamp and high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). We then describe the potential of using HD-MEAs in studying axonal physiology in more detail. Due to their robustness, amenability to high-throughput and high spatiotemporal resolution, HD-MEAs can provide a direct functional electrical readout of single cells and cellular ensembles at subcellular resolution. HD-MEAs can, therefore, be employed in investigating axonal pathologies, the effects of large-scale genomic interventions (e.g., with RNAi or CRISPR) or in compound screenings. A combination of extracellular microelectrode arrays (MEAs), intracellular microelectrodes and optical imaging may potentially reveal yet unexplored repertoires of axonal functions.},

  abstract        = {The recording radius and spatial selectivity of an extracellular probe are important for interpreting neurophysiological recordings but are rarely measured. Moreover, an analysis of the recording biophysics of multisite probes (e.g., tetrodes) can provide for source characterization and localization of spiking single units, but this capability has remained largely unexploited. Here we address both issues quantitatively. Advancing a tetrode (≈40-μm contact separation, tetrahedral geometry) in 5- to 10-μm steps, we repeatedly recorded extracellular action potentials (EAPs) of single neurons in the visual cortex. Using measured spatial variation of EAPs, the tetrodes' measured geometry, and a volume conductor model of the cortical tissue, we solved the inverse problem of estimating the location and the size of the equivalent dipole model of the spike generator associated with each neuron. Half of the 61 visual neurons were localized within a radius of ≈100 μm and 95% within ≈130 μm around the tetrode tip (i.e., a large fraction was much further than previously thought). Because of the combined angular sensitivity of the tetrode's leads, location uncertainty was less than one-half the cell's distance. We quantified the spatial dependence of the probability of cell isolation, the isolated fraction, and the dependence of the recording radius on probe size and equivalent dipole size. We also reconstructed the spatial configuration of sets of simultaneously recorded neurons to demonstrate the potential use of 3D dipole localization for functional anatomy. Finally, we found that the dipole moment vector, surprisingly, tended to point toward the probe, leading to the interpretation that the equivalent dipole represents a "local lobe" of the dendritic arbor.},

  abstract     = {Laminar population analysis (LPA) is a method for analysis of electrical data recorded by linear multielectrodes passing through all lamina of cortex. Like principal components analysis (PCA) and independent components analysis (ICA), LPA offers a way to decompose the data into contributions from separate cortical populations. However, instead of using purely mathematical assumptions in the decomposition, LPA is based on physiological constraints, i.e., that the observed LFP (low-frequency part of signal) is driven by action-potential firing as observed in the MUA (multi-unit activity; high-frequency part of the signal). In the presently developed generalized laminar population analysis (gLPA) the set of basis functions accounting for the LFP data is extended compared to the original LPA, thus allowing for a better fit of the model to experimental data. This enhances the risk for overfitting, however, and we therefore tested various versions of gLPA on virtual LFP data in which we knew the ground truth. These synthetic data were generated by biophysical forward-modeling of electrical signals from network activity in the comprehensive, and well-known, thalamocortical network model developed by Traub and coworkers. The results for the Traub model imply that while the laminar components extracted by the original LPA method overall are in fair agreement with the ground-truth laminar components, the results may be improved by use of gLPA method with two (gLPA-2) or even three (gLPA-3) postsynaptic LFP kernels per laminar population.},

Laminar current source density and multiunit activity profiles were sampled with linear array multielectrodes during penetrations of the posterior superior temporal plane in three macaque monkeys. At each recording site, auditory responses to binaural clicks, pure tones, and band-passed noise, all presented by earphones, were compared with somatosensory responses evoked by contralateral median nerve stimulation. Subjects were awake but were not required to discriminate the stimuli. Borders between A1 and surrounding belt regions were identified by mapping best frequency and stimulus preferences and by subsequent histological analysis. Regions immediately caudomedial to A1 had robust somatosensory responses co-represented with auditory responses. In these regions, both somatosensory and auditory response profiles had "feedforward" patterns; initial excitation beginning in Lamina 4 and spreading to extragranular laminae. Auditory and somatosensory responses displayed a high degree of temporal overlap. Anatomical reconstruction indicated that the somatosensory input region includes, but may not be restricted to, the caudomedial auditory association cortex. As was earlier reported for this region, auditory frequency tuning curves were broad and band-passed noise responses were larger than pure tone responses. No somatosensory responses were observed in A1. These findings suggest a potential neural substrate for multisensory integration at an early stage of auditory cortical processing.},

  abstract        = {Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep structures. Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca  imaging offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70 × 20-μm cross-section shank. The 6 × 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.},

  year        = {2016},
  abstract    = {A method is presented for the reduction of morphologically detailed microcircuit models to a point-neuron representation without human intervention. The simplification occurs in a modular workflow, in the neighborhood of a user specified network activity state for the reference model, the "operating point". First, synapses are moved to the soma, correcting for dendritic filtering by low-pass filtering the delivered synaptic current. Filter parameters are computed numerically and independently for inhibitory and excitatory input using a Green's function approach. Next, point-neuron models for each neuron in the microcircuit are fit to their respective morphologically detailed counterparts. Here, generalized integrate-and-fire point neuron models are used, leveraging a recently published fitting toolbox. The fits are constrained by currents and voltages computed in the morphologically detailed partner neurons with soma corrected synapses at three depolarizations about the user specified operating point. The result is a simplified circuit which is well constrained by the reference circuit, and can be continuously updated as the latter iteratively integrates new data. The modularity of the approach makes it applicable also for other point-neuron and synapse models. The approach is demonstrated on a recently reported reconstruction of a neocortical microcircuit around an in vivo-like working point. The resulting simplified network model is benchmarked to the reference morphologically detailed microcircuit model for a range of simulated network protocols. The simplified network is found to be slightly more sub-critical than the reference, with otherwise good agreement for both quantitative and qualitative validations.},
