In most applications of volume conductor (VC) theory, 
the conductivity of brain tissue, $\sigma_\text{t}$, is assumed to be a constant, 
and its value is normally taken from some experimental measurement. 
Estimates of $\sigma_\text{t}$ vary between different recordings, 
but common values are between 0.1 and 0.5  \si{S/m}.

Assuming a constant $\sigma_\text{t}$ amounts to assuming that brain tissue 
is homogeneous, isotropic and frequency independent, as we did throughout \Fref{chap:VC}.
In reality, $\sigma_\text{t}$ is neither strictly homogeneous, isotropic nor frequency independent, 
and in this chapter we discuss these assumptions and ways to relax them. 
In addition, we discuss some experimental and theoretical estimates of  $\sigma_\text{t}$. 

Before we start examining the properties of $\sigma_\text{t}$, we must establish a clear picture
of what it represents, i.e., what $\sigma_\text{t}$ is the conductivity \textit{of}.
Such a picture is established through the continuous, porous medium approximation 
that we introduce in the following section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
When we presented the theory for modeling single neurons (in \Fref{chap:Neuron}), 
we may have given the impression that they are solitary creatures 
living in a vast extracellular space with long distances to their nearest cell neighbors. 
This mental image may stem from early staining procedures developed by Santiago Ram\'{o}n y Cajal, 
based on the Golgi-method \cite**{cajal1899}, 
where only a small fraction of the neurons were stained and observed. 
Judging from the beautiful images produced by Cajal, 
the brain appeared rather sparsely populated by neurons, 
and if this had been the case, 
the tissue conductivity would have been close to that of the extracellular fluid. 
However, in reality the brain is so densely packed with neurons and glial cells 
that if they all had been stained, Cajal's images would have been pure black. 

As illustrated in \fref{fig:Sigma:ECS}, the extracellular space (colored light blue in the figure) 
occupies only about 20\% of the the total tissue volume, 
and has a highly tortuous \index{Tortuosity} geometry, 
with an average extracellular distance between cell membranes of only about 40-60~nm \cite**{Sykova2008}.
Currents moving through tissue are typically assumed to move predominantly through the extracellular space, 
while the cell bodies are effectively non-conducting obstacles \cite**{Robinson1968,Nunez2006}. 
Tissue currents are then restricted to follow narrow winding paths 
through the small extracellular fraction of the tissue volume,
and we therefore expect the effective tissue conductivity to be lower than 
that of an obstacle-free saline solution.

\caption[]{\textbf{Illustration of a piece of brain tissue.} Extracellular space (light blue) occupies only about a fraction $\alpha$ of the total tissue volume, and has a highly tortuous structure. The tortuosity, $\lambda$, is defined as the ratio between the shortest pathway between two points in space and the euclidian distance between these two points, and accounts for the fact that ions traveling through the medium do not travel in straight lines, but need to take detours around cellular obstacles.
(A) $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ vary on the microscopic scale. For example, the shortest path (red dotted curve) between locations $r_0$ and $r_1$ is more tortuous than the path between locations $r_0$ and $r_2$. (B) On a larger spatial scale, local inhomogeneities average out, and the tissue can be treated as homogeneous. Typical tissue averages for $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are 0.2 and 1.6, respectively \cite**{Nicholson1998,Sykova2008}. \ghnote{Omform figur i traad m/ figtekst}

\ghnote{Torbjorn foreslo:} \ghtxt{"From this, we can already make a first rough estimate of the extracellular conductivity: The extracellular saline solution has a conductivity of about 1.5~\si{\siemens\per\metre}, but only occupies about 20\% of the space, meaning that we might expect the extracellular conductivity to be on the order of 1.5~\si{\siemens\per\metre} $\cdot$ 0.2 = 0.3~\si{\siemens\per\metre}. This value fits well with the values typically measured in experiments, although the calculation itself vastly underestimates the complex electrical properties of neural tissue. "} \ghnote{Ganske fint, men tar ikke hensyn til tortuositeten, noe jeg gjoer i punktlisten ikke langt nedenfor her. Frykter derfor at dette grovestimatet vil forvirre leseren, naar et anelsen mindre grovt estimat foelger saa tett nedenfor.}


At the spatial scale of micrometers and below, the extracellular conductivity \index{Conductivity} 
$\sigma$ is \tvntxt{therefore} highly non-homogeneous and anisotropic. 
For example, the local conductivity in a certain spatial direction will depend on whether there locally is a free extracellular passage in that direction (high conductivity), 
or whether this passage is blocked by a nearby membrane (low conductivity) (\fref{fig:Sigma:ECS}{\bf A}). 
%Likewise, also the electric potential $\phi$ will vary greatly over tiny distances, depending on the proximity to neural membranes, especially when approaching the nanometer thick Debye-layers building up the membrane charge \cite**{Pods2013}\tvnnote{Kanskje denne setningen hoerer mer hjemme i VC eller Basics?}.
%When we study extracellular potentials, we are typically not interested in these microscopic variations in $\sigma$ and $\phi$, but rather in the values of these entities when averaged over some spatial volume. Electrodes used to record extracellular potentials typically have sizes ranging from 5 $\mu$m to 125 $\mu$m in diameter \cite**{Viswam2019}, which is larger than the typical diameter of a dendrite ($\sim$ 1 $\mu$m). In practice, the electrodes therefore perform such an averaging, and include contributions from several nearby neurons \tvnnote{Remove last half of sentence? Seems like a different issue to me}. \tvnnote{Tok bort dette, da jeg tenker vi dekker dette et annet sted?}
At a larger spatial scale, of tens or hundreds of micrometers, 
it is however reasonable to assume that these micrometer scale inhomogeneities average out (\fref{fig:Sigma:ECS}{\bf B}), and that brain tissue can be treated as a continuous, porous medium \cite**{Nicholson1981,Gratiy2017}. This assumption is further motivated by the lack of any alternative way to approach the problem, since we in most experimental settings do not know the exact microstructure of the brain. The VC theory presented in the previous chapter was based on the continuous, porous medium approximation, and thus describes the extracellular dynamics on a coarse-grained spatial resolution larger than at least a few micrometers.

A continuous, porous medium is defined by two key parameters \cite**{Nicholson1981}. The first parameter, $\alpha$, is the fraction of the tissue volume that is extracellular space. The second parameter is $\lambda$, the tortuousity of the extracellular medium \cite**{Nicholson1981}. It is defined as the ratio between the shortest extracellular pathway between two points in space and the euclidian distance between these two points. The tortuousity accounts for the fact that ions traveling through the medium do not travel in straight lines, but need to take detours around cellular obstacles. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ can be measured experimentally. Typical values are $\alpha = 0.2$ and $\lambda = 1.6$ \cite**{Sykova2008}, although these values vary between brain regions, and also locally with in a brain region, due to brain-state dependent cellular swelling or shrinkage \cite**{Sykova2008,rasmussen2020}.

The continuous, porous medium approximation has implications for how we interpret the various concepts and variables that we use to compute extracellular potentials. In particular, it is important for how we understand the conductivity of the tissue medium. 
Below, we give an interpretation of what the tissue conductivity ($\sigma_\text{t}$) represents. To do this, we first define two other conductivity measures: (i) that of the extracellular saline solution ($\sigma_\text{saline}$), and (ii) that of the extracellular medium ($\sigma_\text{e}$), and then explain how (iii) the tissue conductivity ($\sigma_\text{t}$) relates to those. 


\subsection{\blue{Conductivity of saline: $\sigma_\text{saline}$}}
\label{sec:Sigma:Ssaline}
\index{Conductivity! of saline solution}
$\sigma_\text{saline}$ (S/m) is the conductivity of the saline solution that fills up the extracellular space. Since this saline solution only exists in the small gaps of space between cells, $\sigma_\text{saline}$ defines the (very) local conductivity within these gaps, and is not the conductivity of brain tissue as a whole. 

The conductivity depends on the availability of free charge carriers, and $\sigma_\text{saline}$ is therefore determined by the ion concentrations in the saline solution:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\text{saline} = \frac{F^2}{RT}\sum_{k} D_k z_{k}^2 c_{k}.
\label{eq:Sigma:sigma1}
\end{equation}
We have previously shown how this definition of the conductivity follows from the Nernst-Planck equation (see \fref{eq:Basics:sigma_conc}). We recall that $z_{k}$, $D_k$ and $c_{k}$ denote the valency, diffusion coefficient and concentration, respectively, of ion species $k$, while $F = 96485.3\, \si{\coulomb\per\mol}$ is the Faraday constant, $R = 8.314 \,\si{\joule\per\kelvin\per\mol}$ is the gas constant, and $T$ (\si{\kelvin}) the temperature.

The concentrations of the most abundant ions in the extracellular space of the brain were listed in \fref{tab:Neuron:ion-concentrations}. To compute $\sigma_\text{saline}$ for this solution, we also need the diffusion coefficients of the involved ions, which are given in \fref{tab:Sigma:diffconsts}. If we insert the values from \fref{tab:iNeuron:on-concentrations} and \fref{tab:Sigma:diffconsts} into \fref{eq:Sigma:sigma1}, and assume a body temperature of $T = 310\, \si{\kelvin}$, we get a conductivity $\sigma_\text{saline} = 1.72 \, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$ This agrees well with experimental measures of $\sigma_\text{saline}$, which typically report values in the range between 1.3 and 1.8~\si{\siemens\per\metre}\cite**{Okada1994,Baumann1997,Logothetis2007,Martinsen2008,Miceli2017}.

\subsection{\blue{Conductivity of extracellular space: $\sigma_\text{e}$}}
\label{sec:Sigma:Se}
$\sigma_\text{e}$ (\si{\siemens\per\metre}) is the conductivity of the \textit{extracellular medium}\index{Extracellular medium}. It is a theoretical quantity, defined as the conductivity experienced by a \textit{theoretical} macroscopic (coarse-grained) current assumed to travel exclusively trough the extracellular part of brain tissue. This current does not move through a 3D volume filled entirely by extracellular saline, but is (i) restricted to move only through the fraction $\alpha$ of the total medium volume that is extracellular, and (ii) must take detours around neural and glial obstacles, as reflected through the tortuousity $\lambda$ \cite**{Nicholson1998,Nunez2006}. 

If we account for the extracellular volume fraction and tortuous structure of the extracellular space, the extracellular conductivity should theoretically be a factor $\alpha/\lambda^2$ lower than saline conductivity\cite**{Okada1994}:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_\text{e} = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda^2} \sigma_\text{saline}.
\label{eq:Sigma:sigmat}
\end{equation}
Typical values for $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ for the extracellular space of brain tissue are 0.2 and 1.6, respectively \cite**{Nicholson1981,Nicholson1998}. With these values, $\sigma_\text{e}$ becomes almost a factor 13 lower than $\sigma_\text{saline}$, and with the above estimate, $\sigma_\text{saline} = 1.72 \, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$, we get a an estimated value $\sigma_\text{e} = 0.134\, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$. 


\subsection{\blue{Conductivity of brain tissue: $\sigma_\text{t}$}}
\label{sec:Sigma:St}
$\sigma_\text{t}$ (\si{\siemens\per\metre}) is the macroscopic (coarse-grained) conductivity of the brain tissue, i.e., the conductivity experienced by a macroscopic (coarse-grained) current traveling through the tissue. It is $\sigma_\text{t}$ that one normally measures experimentally, and it is $\sigma_\text{t}$ that is the relevant for use in VC theory. 

If currents through brain tissue were indeed confined to stay exclusively in the extracellular part of it, $\sigma_\text{t}$ should be identical to $\sigma_\text{e}$, defined above. However, if tissue currents cross membranes and to some degree take intracellular pathways in addition to the extracellular ones, we would expect $\sigma_\text{t}$ to be greater than $\sigma_\text{e}$ \cite**{Okada1994}.

Measured values of $\sigma_\text{t}$ vary quite much between different experiments, but a typical value is $\geq 0.2 \, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$, which is higher than the value $\sigma_\text{e} = 0.134\, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$ that we estimated above. The reason why the estimated $\sigma_\text{e}$ is lower than $\sigma_\text{t}$, is expectedly that a fraction of the real tissue currents do travel through intracellular pathways. For example, in cerebellum, it has been estimated that about 50 \% of tissue currents travel through intracellular paths \cite**{Okada1994}. A possible additional explanation is that the extracellular solution contains many ions (such as e.g., H$^+$ and HPO4$^{2-}$ ) that we did not include in Table \ref{Neuron:tab:ion-concentrations} and thus not in our calculation of $\sigma_\text{t}$. However, since concentrations of ions others than those in Table \ref{Neuron:tab:ion-concentrations} are quite low, they will probably have only a minor impact on the conductivity.

\section{\red{Frequency dependence of the conductivity}}
\label{sec:Sigma:f-independent}
\index{Conductivity!Frequency dependence}
%\ghnote{GH: Skrev skisse til dette. Puttet figuren m/ sigma-maalinger inn her, da disse ser ut til aa primaert diskuteres opp mot eventuell frekvensavhengighet. Mulig vi burde ha med "eksperimentelle maalinger i kapittel-tittelen?}
%Regardless of the level of isotropy and homogeneity of a medium, its response to an imposed alternating current can depend on the frequency of the current. Then, the conductivity contains a resistive part, which is real and frequency independent, and an imaginary part that accounts for capacitive and inductive effects that are frequency dependent.
An important question when modeling and interpreting electric signals in neuroscience is whether the conductivity of neural tissue is frequency dependent. If a substantial frequency dependence is present, this would mean that the recorded signals are distorted as they propagate through the tissue, and it would bias recordings towards certain parts of the frequency spectrum. In this subsection we will briefly cover the experimental measurements investigating this issue, as well as the theory needed to model such effects, should it be deemed necessary.

As we stated earlier, extracellular currents often are assumed to move mostly through the extracellular saline solution, so that the cells can basically be treated as passive, non-conducting obstacles (\fref{sec:Sigma:continuous}). If this is true, we would expect the extracellular conductivity to be frequency-independent, since saline is known to be a purely resistive medium \cite**{Martinsen2008}. 

A frequency dependent tissue conductivity would, however, not in itself be surprising: As we have seen, the extracellular space is tightly packed with neurons, and because of the capacitive properties of their membranes, their membrane conductivity is highly frequency dependent (\fref{sec:Neuron:Cap}). One could therefore easily imagine that low-frequency extracellular currents are more confined to move resistively through the extracellular space, while high-frequency extracellular currents could move both resistively through the extracellular space and capacitively through the cells. This would effectively introduce a higher conductivity for higher frequencies, thereby reducing the amplitude of high-frequency extracellular potentials (see \fref{eq:Sigma:pointsource_freq_dep}). This would for example imply that the low-frequency LFP signals are less attenuated than the high-frequency spikes. It has been suggested that "stability" of LFP and sensitivity of spikes to position is caused by this, and EEG has "only" low frequencies \cite**{Logothetis2007}, and 1/f power-laws in LFP \tvnnote{Expand a little on this and cite the French}.

Earlier investigations of the frequency dependence of the extracellular conductivity (also called the impedance spectrum) reported little or no frequency dependence \cite**{Ranck1963,nicholson1975,Pfurtscheller1975}. However, a later study by \citeasnoun**{Gabriel1996} reported a substantial frequency dependence, in particular below 100~\si{\hertz} (\fref{fig:Sigma:freq_dep}). More recent studies again seemed to measure little or no frequency dependence of the extracellular conductivity \cite**{Logothetis2007,Elbohouty2013,Wagner2014,Dowrick2015,Miceli2017,Ranta2017,Avery2017}. 
Many of these studies consistently measured an increase of the conductivity of about 20-50\% from a few hertz to some hundreds or thousands of hertz. However, at least in some cases, a similar frequency dependence was also measured in saline, indicating that this frequency dependence at least partially originated in the recording equipment \cite**{Logothetis2007,Miceli2017}. \ghnote{Argumentet forutsetter at saline IKKE har en f-avhengighet. Er dette aapenbart, eller noe vi boer kommentere? De som maaler epsilon og sigma for saltloesninger snakker vanligvis om "the low-frequency conductivity", som antyder en eller annen f-avhengighet. Men low betyr nok da alt under gigahertz (charge relaxation), saa det er sikkert rett aa forvente null f-avhengighet for vaare omstendigheter.}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/Sigma/frequency_dependence.png}
\end{center}
\caption[]{\textbf{Literature review of reported conductivities in various species and experimental setups.}
Most studies seem to indicate a very weak frequency dependence of the extracellular conductivity\index{Conductivity}, which would have a negligible effect on measured extracellular potentials \cite**{Miceli2017}. The very low and strongly frequency dependent values measured by \cite**{Gabriel1996} represents an outlier, and although it has received substantial attention, it has to the best of our knowledge not been reproduced by any other study. For details about the data, see \cite**{Miceli2017}, and references therein \cite**{Ranck1963,Gabriel1996,Logothetis2007,Elbohouty2013,Wagner2014}.
}
\label{fig:Sigma:freq_dep}
\end{figure}

The study by \citeasnoun**{Gabriel1996} clearly stands out, as it is the only study to our knowledge to experimentally measure a strong frequency dependence for low frequencies. This study also reported a conductivity of only about 0.03~\si{\siemens/ \metre} at 10~\si{\hertz}, about an order of magnitude lower than the commonly reported values. This value seems surprisingly low, given that healthy neural tissue contains a substantial fraction of highly conducting saline. The authors were however careful to note that the reported low-frequency values might be distorted by inadequate correction for electrode polarization (see \fref{sec:VC:electrodes} for a brief review of electrode polarization). Further, a later study using the same recording equipment did not observe a similarly strong frequency-dependence, or similarly low conductivity values (\citeasnoun**{Wagner2014}; \fref{fig:Sigma:freq_dep}). Finally, their recording were done in bovine brains obtained from a slaughterhouse up to a couple of hours post-mortem \cite**{Gabriel1996}, which can potentially have resulted in suboptimal tissue preservation and cell swelling. 

Consequently, experimental data is consistent with neural tissue being resistive, or with having at most a weak frequency dependency of the order of up to $\sim$30\% over the frequency range of interest for neurophysiology (below a few thousand hertz). This might not sound very small, but modeling studies of frequency dependencies of this order has indicated that it would have a relatively minor effect on measured potentials \ghtxt{of physiological origin} \cite**{Bossetti2008,Tracey2011,Miceli2017}\tvnnote{Add figure adapted from Miceli2017?}. We note however that this is not necessarily true for potentials evoked by extracellular current stimulation using very brief current pulses, because of the very high frequency content of the pulses \cite**{Bossetti2008}. \ghtxt{We will revisit the topic of electrode stimulations in \fref{chap:Stim}, but will for now focus on physiological signals.}


\subsection{\red{Complex conductivity}}
\label{sec:Sigma:Complex}
If capacitive effects are present in tissue current, these can be accounted for is the CSD equation (\fref{eq:Basics:continuity2}) by replacing the tissue conductivity $\sigma_\text{t}$ with a complex conductivity $\sigma_\text{c}$:
\begin{equation}
{\bf \nabla} \cdot \left(\sigma_\text{c} {\bf \nabla} {\phi} \right) = -C,
\label{eq:Sigma:compexCSD}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_\text{c} = \sigma_\text{c}(\omega)$ depends on the the angular frequency $\omega = 2 \pi f$ of the electric field. 

To define this complex conductivity, we start with the total (conductive plus capacitive) current through the medium:
\begin{equation}
{\bf i} = \sigma_\text{t}{\bf E} +  \epsilon \frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t},
\label{eq:Sigma:itot}
\end{equation}.
and consider an oscillatory electric field:
\begin{equation}
{\bf E} = {\bf E}_{max}e^{j\omega t}, 
\label{eq:Sigma:Eomega}
\end{equation}.
where $j$ is the imaginary unit, and $\omega$ the angular oscillation frequency of field (or a component of it). If we insert \fref{eq:Sigma:Eomega} into \fref{eq:Sigma:itot}, we can write the current as:
\begin{equation}
{\bf i} = \left( \sigma_\text{t} + j\omega \epsilon \right) {\bf E}, 
\label{eq:Sigma:itot2}
\end{equation}
or as:
\begin{equation}
{\bf i} = \sigma_\text{c} {\bf E}, 
\label{eq:Sigma:itot3}
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the complex conductivity:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\text{c} = \sigma_\text{t}(\omega)\left(1 + \frac{j \omega \epsilon(\omega)}{\sigma_\text{t}(\omega)} \right).
\label{eq:Sigma:complex}
\end{equation}
We note that \fref{eq:Sigma:itot3} is generally only valid in the frequency domain, while in the time domain, ${\bf i}$ must be given as a temporal convolution of $\sigma$ and ${\bf E}$ \cite**{Bedard2009}. \ghnote{Jeg tok dette fra Pettersen 2012. Skal vi si mer om saken, eller holder dette? Vi har ikke forklart hva time-domain og frequency-domain betyr.}

The real and imaginary parts of $\sigma_\text{c}$ correspond to the conductive and capacitive properties of the medium, respectively. As indicated, both components can have an individual frequency dependence through $\sigma_\text{t}(\omega)$ and $\epsilon(\omega)$. \ghnote{Burde nok si noe om hvorfor $\sigma_t$ "plutselig" er frekvensavheng "internt" - det kunne den vel ogsaa ha vaert tidligere, dvs. uten at vi hadde med kapasitivt ledd?} However, we note that these "individual" frequency dependencies are not independent: To obey causality, that is, that the extracellular potential originating from a current can not precede the current, there must be a certain relationship between $\sigma_\text{t}(\omega)$ and $\epsilon(\omega)$, which can be found from the Kramers-Kronig relation, or equivalently from the Bode relation between the magnitude of the conductivity $|\sigma(\omega)|$ and the induced phase-shift $\exp ^{-{\bf j} \theta(f)}$. \ghnote{Det stemmer sikkert, men foeler det trengs noe mer her. I det minste noen referanser?}

If we use \fref{eq:Sigma:compexCSD} with a complex conductivity as a starting point for VC theory,  the point-source equation (\fref{eq:VC:pointsource}) becomes \cite**{plonsey1967,Bossetti2008,Miceli2017}:
\begin{equation}
\phi({\bf r}, \omega) = \frac{I(\omega)}{4\pi (\sigma_\text{t}(\omega) + j \omega \epsilon(\omega)) r},
\label{eq:Sigma:pointsource_freq_dep}
\end{equation}
\tvnnote{notation must be fixed. }
\ghnote{fixed it. I kept the imaginary unit in math-mode - i think this is the standard?}


\subsection{\red{Estimates of the capacitive effects in tissue currents}}
\label{sec:Sigma:Estimates}
From \fref{eq:Sigma:complex} it is clear that the capacitive contribution (last term) is negligible compared to the conductive contribution (first term) when the ratio:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\omega \epsilon}{\sigma_\text{t}} = \frac{2 \pi f \epsilon}{\sigma_\text{t}} = \ll 1.
\label{eq:Sigma:ratiocondition}
\end{equation}

An alternative version of this ratio is:
\begin{equation}
2 \pi f \tau \ll 1, 
\label{eq:Sigma:ratiocondition2}
\end{equation}
which follows from \fref{eq:Sigma:ratiocondition} if we recognize
\begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{\epsilon}{\sigma}, 
\label{eq:Sigma:chargerelaxationtime}
\index{Charge-relaxation} 
\end{equation}
as the charge relaxation time in a linear medium. To see this, we start with taking the divergence ($\nabla\cdot$) of \fref{eq:Sigma:itot}. Since the total current in solenoidal ($\nabla\cdot{\bf i} = 0$), this gives us:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\text{t}\nabla\cdot{\bf E} +  \epsilon \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla\cdot {\bf E}\right) = 0.
\label{eq:Sigma:OnTheRoadAgain}
\end{equation}
Next, we insert Gauss's law for electricity (${\bf \nabla}\cdot {\bf E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon}$), to obtain:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} \rho = 0,
\label{eq:Sigma:OhmicConcervation2}
\end{equation}
which is a differential equation with the general solution
\begin{equation}
\rho({\bf r}, t) = \rho({\bf r}, 0)e^{-\sigma t/\epsilon} = \rho({\bf r}, 0)e^{-t/\tau}.
\label{eq:Sigma:relax}
\end{equation}
\Fref{eq:Basics:relax} shows that there is no steady-state free charge in the system considered, and that if any nonzero free charge occurs, for example due to sudden change in the electric field, it will decay towards zero with the time constant $\tau$. From this, the interpretation of $\epsilon/\sigma$ (\fref{eq:Basics:chargerelaxationtime}) as the charge relaxation time is clear. 

The ratio \Fref{eq:Sigma:ratiocondition2} tells us that only for frequencies that are very high (approaching the order of one oscillation per charge relaxation time), capacitive effects will be important. For fields of physiological origin, the temporal frequencies are typically less than a few thousand \si{\hertz}. Capacitive effects will therefore mainly be important if the charge relaxation time is not much smaller than a millisecond. Below, we explore whether the criterion in \fref{eq:Basics:ratiocondition} or \fref{eq:Basics:ratiocondition2} is met in three different mediums:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Extracellular saline solution:} To approximate the charge relaxation time for the saline solution, we use (i) that $\sigma_\text{saline} \sim 1.5 \, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$ (see \fref{sec:Sigma:Ssaline}), and (ii) that the relative permittivity ($\epsilon_\text{r} = \epsilon/\epsilon_0$) of dilute salt water solutions is approximately the same as that for water, which for the low field frequencies of physiological signals is $\epsilon_\text{r} \sim 80$ \cite**{hasted1948}. This gives a value $\tau = \epsilon_\text{r} \epsilon_0/\sigma \sim 80\times 8.85\times10^{-12}/1.5 \approx 0.5 \, \si{\nano\second}$. A nanosecond-fast charge relaxation implies that the displacement current will mainly be important under conditions when the electrical field varies with frequencies in the gigahertz range. The relevant fields with physiological origin vary with frequencies that are orders of magnitude lower than this, which implies that capacitive effects can safely be neglected. With $\tau = 0.5 \, \si{\nano\second}$ and $f = 1000 \, \si{\hertz}$, $2 \pi f \tau \approx 3 \times 10^{-6}$, and the criterion in \fref{eq:Basics:ratiocondition2} is clearly met.

\item \textit{Neural membrane:}  The time constant for a neural membrane varies depending on what kinds of ion channels that are open. The passive time constant, $\tau_\text{m}$, is for mammalian central neurons normally estimated to 
be in the range from 20 to 100 \si{\milli\second} \cite**{koch1996}. With $\tau_\text{m}$ in this range, and $f = 1000 \, \si{\hertz}$, $2 \pi f \tau_\text{m} > 100$, which shows that capacitive effects clearly can not be neglected for membrane currents. 

Before we go on, let us verify that the membrane time constant $\tau_\text{m}$ has the interpretation of a charge relaxation time, $\tau=\epsilon/\sigma$: Firstly, the permittivity of a parallel plate capacitor is related to specific capacitance through $\epsilon = c_\text{m} d$ where $d$ is the distance between the conductors. For the neural membrane, the conductors are the intra- and extracellular saline solutions, and $d$ is the membrane thickness. Secondly, conductivity (\si{\siemens\per\metre}) is related to conductance $g$ (\si{\siemens\per\square\metre}) through $\sigma = gd$, where $d$ is the "conduction distance". For the membrane, $d$ is, again, the membrane thickness, and we can take $g$ to be the passive membrane conductance $g = g_\text{m}$, which is the inverse of the passive resistance $g_\text{m}=1/r_\text{m}$. With this, $\tau_\text{m} = \epsilon_\text{m}/\sigma_\text{m} = (c_\text{m}d)/(g_\text{m}d) = c_\text{m}r_\text{m}$, which is the classical definition of the passive membrane time constant \cite**{koch1996}. 

From the above, we can also calculate $\epsilon_\text{m}$ and $\sigma_\text{m}$ for the passive membrane. With a typical membrane thickness $d \sim 10^{-8} \, \si{\metre}$, and the typical specific membrane capacitance $c_m \sim 10^{-2} \si{\farad\per\square\metre}$, we find that $\epsilon_\text{m} \sim 10^{-10} \, \si{\farad\per\metre}$. With a typical membrane time constant $\tau_\text{m} = 50 \, \si{\milli\second}$, we then obtain $\sigma_\text{m} = \epsilon_\text{m}/\tau_\text{m} \sim 
2\times10^{-9} \, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$. This corresponds to a passive membrane resistance $r_\text{m} = d/\sigma_\text{m} = 10^{-8}/2\times10^{-9} = 5\, \si{\ohm\square\metre} = 50 \, \si{\kilo\ohm\square\centi\metre}$.

\ghnote{Dette ble et sidespor. Vi kan vurdere aa fjerne alt bortsett fra foerste avsnitt. For min egen sjelefred ville jeg dog verifisere at membrantidskonstanten rettmesig kan tolkes som charge-relaxation time i membran-mediumet.}

\item \textit{Neural tissue:} For the topic of this book, the most relevant medium is the neural tissue as a whole. For tissue, the ratio in \fref{eq:Sigma:ratiocondition} is strongly frequency dependent, because the permittivity $\epsilon(f)$ of tissue decreases rather sharply with $f$ in the low frequency-range. Data from \citeasnoun**{gabriel1996compilation} suggests that relative permittivity of grey matter, $\epsilon_\text{r}$, decreases from $4\times10^7$ to $1.6\times 10^5$ over the frequency range from 10 to 1000 \si{\hertz}. The conductivity does not change that much with frequency. If we assume the commonly measured value $\sigma = 0.2 \, \si{\siemens\per\metre}$, the ratio $2\pi\epsilon_\text{r}\epsilon_0/\sigma$ becomes $\approx 0.1$ at $f = 10 \, \si{\hertz}$ and $\approx 0.04 $ at $f = 1000 \, \si{\hertz}$. These values are much larger than the corresponding value found for the extracellular saline solution, and reflects the fact that currents passing through tissue will to some degree interact with neural membranes. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of the capacitive current is fairly low also in tissue, meaning that resistive currents will dominate. We note that there is quite some variation in experimental estimates of  $\epsilon_\text{r}$ and $\sigma$ for the tissue medium, but they are normally of the same order of magnitude as the values used in the calculation above.

%In this book, we will not use \fref{eq:Basics:complexsigma}, but keep the two current types separate, as we did in \fref{sec:Basics:onlyohmic}. Furthermore, for extracellular tissue currents we have argued that the capacitive effects are negligible, so that they are determined by \fref{eq:Basics:bertil} with a real $\sigma$. As we also make the quasi-electrostatic approximation of Maxwell's equations (\fref{sec:Basics:Quasielectrostatic}), ${\bf E}$ can be written as the gradient of an electric potential, so that the extracellular drift current density is given \fref{eq:Basics:Ohm_3D_phi}, and so that we can take \fref{eq:Basics:continuity2} as our starting point when deriving the VC theory in \Fref{chap:VC}.


%%%%


%In Section \ref{chap:VC:onlyohmic}) we argued that the extracellular displacement current is negligible, which means that the extracellular medium in itself (and thus $\sigma_\text{e}$) does not exhibit any capacitive effects. This alone does not rule out the possibility that the effective conductivity of the tissue medium ($\sigma_\text{t}$) includes capacitive effects, as currents traveling through it could interact with nearby capacitive neural membranes.

%However, for the relevant frequencies in extracellular recordings (\fref{fig:Sigma:freq_dep}), the capacitive and inductive effects appear to be negligible compared to the resistive effects \cite**{Logothetis2007,Miceli2017,Ranta2017}. In most applications of VC theory, one therefore applies the assumption that the medium is Ohmic or resistive, meaning that the imaginary and frequency dependent part of the conductivity is zero. We note, however, that it is possible to expand the formalism to include a frequency dependent conductivity \cite**{Bedard2004,Tracey2011,Miceli2017}.

\section{\blue{Anisotropic conductivity}}
\label{sec:Sigma:Anisotropic}
\index{Conductivity!Anisotropic}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Neural tissue typically has clearly anisotropic geometrical properties. For example, the very numerous cortical pyramidal cells tend to be geometrically aligned along the depth direction of cortex. It makes intuitive sense that this anisotropy could also be reflected in the conductivity, so that the conductivity in the depth direction of cortex could differ from the conductivity  in the perpendicular directions. 

In \fref{chap:VC}, we assumed that the tissue conductivity $\sigma_\text{t}$ was isotropic, i.e., the same in all the spatial directions. However, in cortex it has been found that the conductivity is about 1.5-fold higher in the depth direction, i.e., for currents running in parallel to the axis of pyramidal cell dendrites \cite**{Goto2010}. The cerebellum has an even more pronounced anisotropic geometrical structure, and the conductivity in the depth direction has been found to be about 3-fold higher than in the perpendicular directions for the anuran cerebellum \cite**{nicholson1975}. Finally, a pronounced anisotropy in the conductivity is typically observed in white matter, because the axons are typically oriented in similar directions by the formation of fiber bundles \cite**{Nicholson1965,Logothetis2007,Bangera2010}. This anisotropy in the conductivity of white matter can in certain cases be as strong as a 10-fold increase in conductivity along the fiber bundle \cite**{Nicholson1965,Bangera2010}.

The overall effect of the anisotropy on extracellular potentials, at least in cortex, often appears to be quite weak \cite**{Logothetis2007,Ness2015,Miceli2017}, and the approximation that $\sigma_\text{t}$ is isotropic often gives good predictions of the potential. See~\fref{fig:Sigma:anisotropy_effect} for an example where a 1.5-fold increase in the conductivity along the axis of the apical dendrite \cite**{Goto2010}, only causes a slightly more squeezed shape of the extracellular potential than the isotropic case \cite**{Ness2015,Miceli2017}. Since extracellular potentials are rather insensitive to modest anisotropies, it is common to assume that the extracellular conductivity, at least in cortex, is isotropic.

When deemed necessary, it is relatively straightforward to expand the VC theory to the case of an anistotropic $\sigma_\text{t}$. Then,  $\sigma_\text{t}$ will no longer be a scalar, but instead a tensor with the three components $\sigma_{tx}$, $\sigma_{ty}$ and $\sigma_{tz}$. If we use the point-source approximation (\fref{eq:VC:pointsources}), the extracellular potential surrounding a set of point current sources $I_k$ is given by \cite**{nicholson1975,Parasnis1986}:

\begin{equation}
\phi(x,y,z) = \sum_k \frac{I_k}{4\pi\sqrt{\sigma_{ty}\sigma_{tz} (x-x_k)^2 + \sigma_{tx}\sigma_{tz} (y-y_k)^2 + \sigma_{tx}\sigma_{ty} (z-z_k)^2}}.
\label{eq:Sigma:Panisos}
\end{equation}
If we use the CSD-description of the sources (eq.~\ref{VC:eq:csds}), the corresponding expression is:
\begin{equation}
\phi(x,y,z) = \iiint_V \frac{C(x,y,z)}{4\pi\sqrt{\sigma_{ty}\sigma_{tz} (x-x_k)^2 + \sigma_{tx}\sigma_{tz} (y-y_k)^2 + \sigma_{tx}\sigma_{ty} (z-z_k)^2}} \, dV.
\label{eq:Sigma:Canisos}
\end{equation}

\section{\blue{Inhomogeneous conductivity}}
\label{sec:Sigma:nonhomo}
\index{Conductivity!Inhomogeneous}
\tvnnote{In- or non-homogeneous?}
\ghnote{Ser at begge deler brukes i litteraturen. Byttet til Inhomogeneous.}
In \fref{chap:VC}, we assumed that the extracellular conductivity $\sigma_\text{t}$ was homogeneous, i.e., the same everywhere. Clearly, this assumption does not hold on the micrometer scale, where neural tissue is highly inhomogeneous \cite**{Nicholson1998}, see \fref{fig:Sigma:ECS}. Also, it clearly does not hold on the very large scale, since, if we travel far enough through brain tissue we will pass through boundaries between different tissue types and sooner or later hit the less conducting skull.
%On a very large spatial scale, for example at the scale of whole brains, it is again clear that the tissue is non-homogeneous, since the brains, even for large primates, are not infinite in size.
However, on a mesoscopic spatial scale the microscale inhomogeneities tend to average out (cf. the continuous medium approximation), while the boundaries to other tissue types or materials are often sufficiently distant to have a negligible effect on local extracellular potentials. In such cases, for example within a given brain region such as cortex, a homogeneous conductivity appears to be a reasonable approximation \cite**{nicholson1975,Okada1994,Logothetis2007,Goto2010,Ness2015}.

There are however still many scenarios where an infinite homogeneous medium is not a reasonable assumption,
typically because of boundaries between neural tissue and other tissue types or materials.
%For example, for electric potentials measured close to the surface of the brain, the transition from neural tissue  (like for ECoG measurements, see also \ref{chap:ECoG}),
%The situation is different when signals are recorded very far from their sources. It is then likely that they on their journey have experienced a $\sigma_\text{t}$ that varied on a macroscopic scale \tvnnote{Er det egentlig riktig aa snakke om "reisen" til et potensial? }.
%For example, electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded outside of the head are strongly affected by the presence of the brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull and scalp, which are very different media with different electrical  conductivities.
When the extracellular medium is inhomogeneous, there is no general analytical formula available (like eqs. \ref{VC:eq:csds}, \ref{eq:Sigma:Panisos} or \ref{eq:Sigma:Canisos}) that link the extracellular potentials to the underlying current sources. In principle, one can however always solve eq. \ref{VC:eq:CSD2} for arbitrarily complex geometries with varying conductivities using numerical methods, like the Finite Element Method (FEM) \cite**{Logg2012}. This approach has for example been used to model electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded outside of the head, because these potentials are not only affected by the conductivity of brain tissue, but also by the presence of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull and scalp, which have widely different conductivities. This is covered in more detail in \fref{chap:EEG}. Substantial inhomogeneities can also be introduced into neural tissue through the presence of big electrode shanks, as briefly discussed in \fref{sec:VC:elec_shafts}.
%For examples of neuroscience applications using this approach, see \cite**{Moffitt2005,Frey2009,Joucla2012,Haufe2015,Ness2015,Buccino2019b,Obien2019}.


\subsection{Planar boundaries: The cortical surface and {\it in vitro} slice recordings}
For some simple and highly symmetric cases of inhomogeneous volume conductors, analytical solutions can be found for calculating extracellular potentials from the underlying current sources. An important example of this is (approximately) planar boundaries between different tissue-types or different materials. In such cases, we can use the Method of Images (MoI)\index{Method of Images} from electrostatics \cite**{Jackson1998} to account for the effect of a planar boundary on the extracellular potential from current sources \cite**{Gold2006,Pettersen2006,Nunez2006,Ness2015,Obien2019}. This is done by introducing virtual current sources on the opposite side of the boundary with the same distance to the boundary as the original point current sources, and with the amplitudes scaled by \cite**{Nunez2006,Ness2015},
\begin{equation}
W = \frac{\sigma_1 - \sigma_2}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}.
\label{eq:Sigma:MoI_scaling}
\end{equation}
Here, $\sigma_1$ is the conductivity of the region containing the real current sources, and $\sigma_2$ is the conductivity of the region at the other side of the boundary containing the virtual sources.
For example, before inserting recording electrodes into the brain the cortical surface will typically be exposed, and materials of widely different conductivity can be used to cover the cortical surface.
To account for the effect of the different conductivity of cortex and the cover material, the point source equation
(\ref{eq:VC:pointsource2}) must be modified \cite**{Nicholson1971,Pettersen2006},
\begin{equation}
\phi({\bf r}) = \frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_\text{t} |{\bf r-r_k}|} + \frac{\sigma_\text{t} - \sigma_{\rm cover}}{\sigma_\text{t} + \sigma_{\rm cover}} \frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_\text{t} |{\bf r-r_k'}|},
\label{eq:Sigma:MoI}
\end{equation}
where ${\bf r}_k'$ is the location of the virtual current source, mirrored across the cortical surface.
Note that the equation on this form is
only valid within the region with the real source, while other formulas apply outside of this region \cite**{Nunez2006}.
The material at the cortical surface can substantially affect potentials measured near the cortical surface, as illustrated in \fref{fig:Sigma:cortical_surface_effect}.
In particular, notice from \fref{eq:Sigma:MoI} the special case of a measurement performed at the planar boundary to a non-conducting region, so that $|{\bf r-r_k}|=|{\bf r-r_k'}|$, and $\sigma_{\rm cover}=0$. In this case, the measured potential will be exactly a factor of two larger than for an infinite homogeneous medium.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The same framework with MoI can also be used to model {\it in vitro} slice recordings, where a small slice of neural tissue is extracted from a brain and placed on a micro-electrode array (MEA), immersed in a saline bath. In this case, there are two planar boundaries, namely the lower boundary between the slice and the non-conducting MEA (glass) electrode plate, and the upper boundary between the slice and the saline bath, see \fref{fig:Sigma:MEA_illustration}.
The two boundaries instead of one gives rise to an infinite series of virtual current sources, which for the simplest case of the measurement being performed at the lower boundary to a non-conducting region, can be written like:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:Sigma:moi_PS}
\phi(x,y,0) & =  & \frac{2I}{4\pi \sigma_\text{t}} \bigg( \psi_{PS}(x,y,z')  \nonumber \\
& + & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} W_{TS}^n\bigg[ \psi_{PS}(x,y,-z' + 2nh) + \psi_{PS}(x,y,-z' - 2nh) \bigg ]\bigg),
\end{eqnarray}
with 
\begin{equation}
\psi_{PS}(x,y,\tilde z) \equiv \left((x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2 + \tilde z^2)\right)^{-1/2}.
\end{equation}
