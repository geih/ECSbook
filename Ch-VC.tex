\index{Volume conductor theory}
As we saw in the previous chapter, multicompartment (MC) models of morphologically complex neurons 
allow us to compute the transmembrane currents at various locations on the neural membrane. 
This chapter is about how we, when we know the distribution of neuronal membrane currents, 
can use volume conductor (VC) theory to predict the resulting extracellular potential ($V_\mathrm{e}$) 
at any given point in space. Volume conductor (VC) theory is the fundament for forward modeling 
of extracellular potentials at different spatial scales, from extracellular spikes, 
LFPs and MUAs, to ECoGs and EEGs. 

The essential idea behind VC theory (in a neuroscience context) is that currents that come 
out through a neural membrane must continue as distributed currents in the extracellular space 
of the surrounding medium, which in turn means that the extracellular potential $V_\mathrm{e}$ 
must change accordingly. Likewise, currents that go inwards through a neural membrane must come 
from distributed currents in the extracellular space of the surrounding medium, and must also be consistent 
with changes in $V_\mathrm{e}$. 

A fairly general staring point for VC theory is the continuity equation (\fref{eq:Basics:continuity1}) 
defined in \Fref{chap:Basics}, which we will revisit and discuss thoroughly towards the end of this 
chapter in \fref{sec:VC:CSD}. Before doing that, we will attempt to establish a basic and intuitive 
understanding of VC theory by following a simpler path, using some simple idealized examples as venture points. 
Before we begin, we note that the computations of $V_\mathrm{e}$ that we will show in this chapter, 
will be based on the assumptions that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Neural transmembrane currents are known from a previous, 
independent simulation (cf. the two-step approach,  \fref{sec:Basics:twostep}). 
As discussed in \fref{sec:Neuron:HHCassumptions}, ephaptic effects are then
not accounted for, i.e., changes in $V_\mathrm{e}$ evoked by neurodynamics 
do not act back on neurodynamics.

\item The extracellular space of brain tissue can be represented as a continuous 
medium\index{continuous medium}, as argued in \fref{sec:Basics:ECSpot}, 
and defined in further detail in \fref{chap:sigma}. 

\item The extracellular current density in this medium is linear and given by 
Ohm's law for volume conductors (see \fref{eq:Basics:Ohm_3D_phi}):
\begin{equation}
{\bf i_t}({\bf r}) = - \sigma_\mathrm{t} \nabla V\mathrm{e}({\bf r}).
\label{eq:VC:ohmici}
\end{equation}
This assumption implies that (i) we have made the quasi-static approximation of Maxwell's equations (see \fref{sec:Basics:Quasistatic}), and assume that diffusive currents in the extracellular space can be neglected
(see \fref{sec:Eldiff}).

\item The effective conductivity ($\sigma_\mathrm{t}$) is constant (does not vary with space or time), 
the same in all directions (isotropic medium), and frequency independent (no capacitive effects on tissue currents).
Although these assumptions are not strictly true, they may still in many cases give fairly good predictions 
of $V_\mathrm{e}$. However, ways to relax these assumptions on $\sigma_\mathrm{t}$ 
are discussed in \Fref{chap:sigma}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\blue{Approximations used in VC theory}}
\label{sec:VC:approximations}

Finally, the extracellular conductivity was throughout this chapter assumed to be isotropic, homogeneous and frequency independent, but it is possible to relax these assumptions. Given its important role, we have devoted an entire chapter of this book to the extracellular conductivity (\fref{chap:Sigma}), where we discuss how the VC theory can be applied also to cases with an anisotropic medium and non-homogeneous medium.

\section{\blue{Point source approximation}}
\label{sec:VC:pointsource}
\index{Point source approximation}
Currents that come out from MC model simulations are typically represented as 
a set of discrete current sources, i.e., one source per neuronal segment, as we illustrated previously in \fref{fig:Basics:CSDillustration}. Let us therefore start as simple as possible, 
and derive the contribution to $V_\mathrm{e}$ from a single neuronal point source 
$I_k$ at the point ${\bf r_k}=0$ (\fref{fig:VC:pointsource}{\bf A}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/VC/EP_from_pointsource_illustration.png}
\end{center}
\caption{\textbf{Extracellular potential from single neuronal point source current.} 
\ghnote{Praktfull, men trenger index $t$ paa $\sigma_t$, og $i_t$ erstatter J.}
}
\label{fig:VC:pointsource}
\end{figure}
Due to the spherical symmetry of this simple case, we know that the current density 
must be radially directed, and that its magnitude must be solely a function of distance $r$ from the source:
\begin{equation}
i_t({\bf r}) = i_t(r) = -\sigma_t \frac{dV_\mathrm{e}(r)}{dr}.
\end{equation}

Since there can be no charge accumulation anywhere inside the sphere, 
the net current $I_k$ injected into the center of the spherical volume with radius $r$ 
must equal the net current leaving through the surface of the volume. 
The net current leaving the surface can in turn be found by multiplying 
the current density $i_t(r)$ at the surface with the surface area $4\pi r^2$. 
We then get the relationship:
\begin{equation}
I_k = -4\pi \sigma_t r^2  \frac{dV_\mathrm{e}(r)}{dr} \, \iff \, \frac{dV_\mathrm{e}(r)}{dr} = -\frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_t r^2 }.
\label{eq:VC:knut}
\end{equation}

To obtain the final solution for $V_\mathrm{e}$, we integrate eq. \ref{eq:VC:knut} from $r$ to $\infty$:
\begin{equation}
\int_{\infty}^r \frac{dV_\mathrm{e}(r')}{dr'} dr' = \int_{\infty}^r -\frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_t r'^2 } dr'.
\label{eq:VC:knut2}
\end{equation}
Since $V_\mathrm{e}({\infty}) = 0$, this leads to the final expression:

\begin{equation}
V({\bf r}) = V(r) = \frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_t r},
\label{eq:VC:pointsource}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the distance from the source.

In the example above, we made things mathematically simple by assuming 
that the current source was placed in the origin ${\bf r} = 0$. 
For a point source located in an arbitrary point ${\bf r_k} $ (\fref{fig:VC:pointsource}{\bf B})), 
the corresponding expression for the extracellular potential is:

\begin{equation}
V({\bf r}) = \frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_t |{\bf r-r_k}|},
\label{eq:VC:pointsource2}
\end{equation}

If we have several point-current sources, $I_{1}, I_2, I_3, ... $, in locations ${\bf r_1}, {\bf r_2}, {\bf r_3} ... $, 
their contributions add up linearly, and the potential in a point ${\bf r}$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
V({\bf r}) = \frac{I_1}{4\pi  \sigma_t {\bf |r-r_1|}} + \frac{I_2}{4\pi  \sigma_t {\bf |r-r_2|} } + \frac{I_3}{4\pi  \sigma_t {\bf |r-r_3|} } + ... = \sum_k \frac{I_k}{4\pi  \sigma_t {\bf |r-r_k|} }.
\label{eq:VC:pointsources}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Fref{eq:VC:pointsources} is referred to as the point-source approximation \cite**{Holt1999}, 
since it approximates the neuron as a set of point current sources, 
i.e., the neuron delivers to the extracellular space a singular current source per neuronal segment, 
located in the segment midpoint.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\blue{Line source approximation}}
\label{sec:VC:linesource}
\index{Line source approximation}
Instead of using the point-source approximation, a more sophisticated choice may be 
to assume that the transmembrane current is evenly distributed over the segment axis, 
a choice which is referred to as the \textit{line-source approximation} \cite**{Holt1999,Linden2014}. 
The contribution to the extracellular potential from a current $I_k$ in a segment $k$ 
can be found analytically by integrating \fref{eq:VC:pointsource} over the center-line axis 
of the compartment (see Appendix \ref{app:linesource} or \citeasnoun**{Holt1998}). 
For a segment with length $\Delta s_k$, the contribution to the extracellular potential will be:

\begin{equation}
V_\mathrm{e}({\bf r})_k = \frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_t} \int \frac{dr_k}{|{\bf r-r_k}|} =
\frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_t \Delta s_k} \log \left| \frac{\sqrt{h_k^2+\rho_k^2}-h_k}{\sqrt{\ell_k^2+\rho_k^2}-\ell_k} \right|.
\label{eq:VC:linesource}
\end{equation}

Here $\rho_k$ is the distance perpendicular to the line segment, 
$h_k$ is the longitudinal distance from the end of the segment, 
and $\ell_k = \delta s_k + h_k$ is the longitudinal distance 
from the start of the segment (\fref{fig:VC:line_source_illustration}). 
\Fref{eq:VC:linesource} and \fref{eq:VC:pointsource} are the equivalent 
expressions where the transmembrane currents in a single neuronal segment 
are treated as a line source and point source, respectively. 
Like for the point-source approximation, the contributions from 
several line-sources add up linearly. 
That is, if we have multiple segments $k$, 
the extracellular potential can be computed as:

\begin{equation}
V_\mathrm{e}({\bf r}) = \sum_k \frac{I_k}{4\pi \sigma_t \Delta s_k} \log \left| \frac{\sqrt{h_k^2+\rho_k^2}-h_k}{\sqrt{\ell_k^2+\rho_k^2}-\ell_k} \right|.
\label{eq:VC:linesources}
\end{equation}

\end{center}
\caption[]{\textbf{Line-source approximation.} Definitions of symbols used in the line-source approximation. }
\label{fig:VC:line_source_illustration}
\end{figure}

The line-source approximation can be expected to give a better prediction of $V_\mathrm{e}$ 
than the point-source approximation at points in space that are very near neuronal membranes, 
especially when it comes to predicting rapid fluctuations in $V_\mathrm{e}$, 
such as spikes, i.e., extracellular signatures of action potentials \cite**{Holt1999}. 
At points further away from membranes, the two approaches give converging predictions, 
see Fig.~\ref{fig:VC:point_vs_linesource}.

The extracellular potential is shown for the time step corresponding to 
the maximum observed absolute value for the extracellular potential, 
and it is calculated from the same neural simulation, at the same time with 
either the point-source approximation ({\bf A}) or the line-source approximation ({\bf B}). 
Very close to neural current sources, the two approaches
give substantially different results, but at slightly larger differences, 
the results from the two approaches converge ({\bf C} versus {\bf D}). 
This is also illustrated in panel {\bf E}, which shows the relative difference 
between the results from the two approaches with increasing distance from the location

and less than 1\% for distances greater than $\sim$35~\si{\micro\metre}.

\section{\blue{Current-source-density description}}
\label{sec:VC:CSD}
\index{Current source density}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Instead of representing neural output as a set of point- or line sources, 
we can express it more generally in terms of a spatially continuous density 
of current sources (\fref{fig:VC:CSD}B), $C({\bf r})$, 
which we call the \textit{current source density}\index{Current source density} (CSD), 
with units \si{A/m^3}. 
The extracellular potential evoked by such a distribution can be computed 
from the general continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot {\bf i_\mathrm{t}}({\bf r}) = - C({\bf r}).
\label{eq:VC:CSD1}
\end{equation}
What \fref{eq:VC:CSD1} tells us, is that if a neuron outputs a current into a (infinitesimal) 
volume of space (the $C$ term), an equally large current leaves that volume as an 
extracellular current (the $\nabla \cdot {\bf i_t}$ term).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/VC/CSD.png}
\end{center}
\caption{\textbf{Neuronal current sources.}  
{\bf (A)} When simulated on a numerical scheme, the transmembrane currents 
are known at a discrete set of neuronal segments, i.e., as a set of point sources.  
{\bf (B)} As a mathematical generality, we can describe the transmembrane currents 
as a current source density (CSD) distribution, $C({\bf r},t)$. 
We note the sum of current entering/leaving a neuron is always zero, 
so that in {\bf (A)}, we must have that $I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4 + I_5= 0$, 
and in {\bf (B)} we have that the spatial integral over $C({\bf r},t)$ 
must be zero at all times.
}
\label{fig:VC:CSD}
\end{figure}

If we (as we do throughout the current chapter) assume purely Ohmic extracellular current densities (${\bf i}_\mathrm{t}$) 
and constant, isotropic conductivity ($\sigma_\mathrm{t}$), eq. \fref{eq:VC:CSD1} reduces to a direct relationship 
between the laplacian (double spatial derivative) of the extracellular potential and the transmembrane current sources: 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_\text{t} \nabla^2{V_\mathrm{e}} = -C.
\label{eq:VC:CSD3}
\end{equation}
We have seen these last two equations earlier as \fref{eq:Basics:continuity1} and \fref{eq:Basics:continuity3}. 
\tvnnote{Dette gjelder kun utenfor sinks/sources da. Nevne det?} 
\ghnote{Den kommentaren stemmer vel ikke? }

If we know the distribution of neuronal current sources, 
we can integrate \fref{eq:VC:continuity3} to predict $V_\mathrm{e}$. 
Since it is a linear differential equation, we can solve it by first finding its Green's function, 
i.e., the solution to an impulse response $C({\bf r}) = I_1 \delta^3({\bf r}-{\bf r}_1)$, 
where $\delta^3({\bf r})$ is the Dirac delta function in three dimensions, 
and $I_1$ represents a singular current source at location ${\bf r}_1$. 
The general solution can then be expressed as a convolution over such Green's functions. 

Thus, we first seek the solution to:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 V({\bf r}) = - \frac{I' \delta^3({\bf r-r'})}{\sigma_t}.
\label{eq:VC:CSD5}
\end{equation}

The reader may realize that that this singular current source is equivalent to the point source 
that we considered earlier. The solution of \fref{eq:VC:CSD5} must therefore be the same 
that we already found in \fref{eq:VC:pointsource2}. 
However, we here provide an alternative (more mathematical) derivation applicable
to more general problems. We start by integrating both sides of \fref{eq:VC:CSD5} 
over an arbitrary 3D volume $\Omega$ containing the source $I_1$:

\begin{equation}
\iiint_{\Omega} \nabla^2V({\bf r}) \,d\Omega =  - \frac{I'}{\sigma_t} \iiint_\Omega \ \delta^3({\bf r-r'}) \, d\Omega,
\label{eq:VC:marit}
\end{equation}

By the definition of the delta-function, the right hand side of \fref{eq:VC:marit} is simply $I_1/\sigma$. 
Using Gauss' theorem, we can convert the volume integral on the left hand side of \fref{eq:VC:marit} 
to an integral over the surface $S$ (enclosing the volume $\Omega$), 
so that \fref{eq:VC:marit} becomes:

\begin{equation}
\oiint_{S} \nabla V({\bf r}) \cdot \, d{\bf S}  = - \frac{I'}{\sigma_t},
\label{eq:VC:berit1}
\end{equation}
To solve this surface integral, it is convenient to chose the volume that we integrate over 
to be a sphere centered at the source location ${\bf r}_1$, 
and with radius $R = |{\bf r}-{\bf r}_1|$ (\fref{fig:VC:pointsource}{\bf B}). 
Due to the symmetry of problem, we then know that the electric potential 
is the same for all ${\bf r}$ on the spherical surface, so that $V({\bf r}) = V(R)$. 
We also know that its gradient $\nabla V({\bf r}) = d V(R)/dR ~{\bf e}_R$ is constant over the surface, 
and perpendicular to the surface increment $d{\bf S} = dS {~\bf e}_R$. 
If we use this, \fref{eq:VC:berit1} becomes:
\begin{equation}
\oiint_{S} \frac{d V(R)}{dR} d{S}  = - \frac{I_1}{\sigma_t},
\label{eq:VC:berit1ogenhalv}
\end{equation}
which has the solution:
\begin{equation}
4\pi R^2 \frac{d V(R)}{dR} = -\frac{I_1}{\sigma_t}
\label{eq:VC:berit2}
\end{equation}
If we integrate this from $\infty$ to $R$, and use that $V(\infty) = 0$, we get:
\begin{equation}
V(R) =  \frac{I_1}{4\pi \sigma_t R}.
\label{eq:VC:berit3}
\end{equation}
We may now insert back for $V(R)= V({\bf r})$ and $R = |{\bf r}-{\bf r}_1|$ to obtain the desired Green's function:

\begin{equation}
V({\bf r})= \frac{I_1}{4\pi \sigma_t |{\bf r}-{\bf r}_1|}.
\label{eq:VC:berit4}
\end{equation}
As earlier stated, the solution for a general CSD can be expressed as a convolution over the Green's function, so that:

\begin{equation}
V({\bf r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \sigma_t}\iiint_{\Omega} \frac{C({\bf r}_s)}{|{\bf r}-{\bf r}_s|} \,d\Omega,
\label{eq:VC:csds}
\end{equation}
where the volume integral runs over all sources with source location denoted ${\bf r}_s$. 
Here, $C$ represents whatever approximation one used for the current sources, 
and \fref{eq:VC:csds} is the continuous counterpart to \fref{eq:VC:pointsources}. 
If we describe the CSD as a sum of point sources, i.e.,  
$C({\bf r}) = \sum_k I_k \delta^3({\bf r} - {\bf r_k})$,  
\fref{eq:VC:csds} reduces to \fref{eq:VC:pointsources}.


\subsubsection{\blue{Derivation of the current-source density equation}}
\label{sec:VC:C2}
\index{Current source density}
Although the CSD equation (\fref{eq:VC:CSD1}) may seem intuitively reasonable, 
we have so far used it more or less as a postulate. Its theoretical and practical basis
was established by the early works by Charles Nicholson and coworkers
\cite**{Nicholson1971,nicholson1973,nicholson1975}.

A rigorous derivation of it was given by \citeasnoun**{Gratiy2017}. 
It is rather cumbersome, and we will not present it in full here, 
but we will walk the interested reader through the main steps of the derivation. 

The starting point is the conservation law for the total current (density):
\begin{equation}
{\bf \nabla} \cdot {\bf i}_\text{tot} = 0.
\label{eq:VC:Sergey1}
\end{equation}
This equation is valid at the spatial scale where it is meaningful to operate with continuous variables 
such as currents (cf. \fref{sec:Basics:scale_jump1}), and is sufficiently localized for the currents
to be defined meaningfully as either intracellular, extracellular or transmembrane currents. 
As such, \fref{eq:VC:Sergey1} would not be practical to use for large-scale tissue processes:
We would have map up the detailed structure of brain tissue with high resolution, 
to account for how the very definition of ${\bf i}_\text{tot}$ varies with space, depending
on whether we are inside or outside of cells.

To get around this problem, we instead seek a version of \fref{eq:VC:Sergey1} 
that is applicable on a larger spatial scale ($\gg 1 \, \si{\cubic\micro\metre}$). 
The diameter of neural dendrites is typically $\sim 1 \,\si{\micro\metre}$, 
which means that a reference volume much greater than this will enclose 
the intracellular spaces of multiple neurites as well as the extracellular space between them. 
The idea is to chose a sufficiently large spatial scale for brain tissue to be homogeneous 
in the sense that any equally sized and arbitrarilly placed reference volume will contain roughly 
the same intracellular to extracellular volume fraction (cf. \fref{sec:Basics:scale_jump2}). 
The advantage with such a \textit{coarse-grained}\index{Coarse-grained} resolution
is that it introduces a bi-domain representation\index{Bi-domain model}, where we may think of brain tissue
as consisting of two co-existing and interacting domains that are both defined 
continuously over the whole tissue-space, rather than within their respective sub-spaces.

To proceed, we define the tissue-coarse grained current $\left<{\bf i}_\text{tot}\right>$ 
as the total current when averaged over the above introduced reference volume. 
Since current conservation must apply also at this larger spatial scale, we have that:
\begin{equation}
{\bf \nabla} \cdot \langle{\bf i}_\text{tot}\rangle = 0.
\label{eq:Basics:Sergey2}
\end{equation}

The next trick is to perform the averaging separately over 
the intracellular (i) and extracellular (e) domains of the reference volume, so that we can write: 
$\langle{\bf i}_\text{tot}\rangle = \langle{\bf i}_\text{tot}\rangle_\text{c} + \langle{\bf i}_\text{tot}\rangle_\text{e}$, 
where the boundary between the i and e domains is chosen to be midways 
inside the neural membranes separating the domains 
\ghnote{Fremdeles ikke 100 prosent i maal her. Sergey skriver ikke noe om hvor grensa gaar, men bare at the surface bounding the volume is the cellular membrane. Tobjorn - hadde du en ref der Sergey saa paa effekter av aa legge grensa andre steder?}. With this, \fref{eq:Basics:Sergey2} becomes: 
\begin{equation}
{\bf \nabla} \cdot \langle{\bf i}_\text{tot}\rangle_\text{c}  + {\bf \nabla}\cdot \langle{\bf i}_\text{tot}\rangle_\text{e} = 0
\label{eq:Basics:Sergey3}
\end{equation}

In \citeasnoun**[Appendix A]{Gratiy2017} it was shown that the divergence of the coarse-grained current density 
over the cellular domain (i.e., the first term on the right in \fref{eq:Basics:Sergey3}) 
can be expressed as a sum of transmembrane currents, 
i.e., as as a current source density ($C$), like in \fref{eq:VC:CSD1}. 
Further, if we rename the average current running extracellularly through tissue 
$\langle{\bf i}_\text{tot}\rangle_\text{e}$ to ${\bf i}_\text{t}$, 
we see that \fref{eq:Basics:Sergey3} becomes identical to  \fref{eq:VC:CSD1}. 

Importantly, ${\bf i}_\text{t}$ interprets as the average current running extracellularly through tissue, 
defined as extracellular current per unit \textit{tissue} cross section area 
and not per \textit{extracellular} cross section area 
(although it only runs through the extracellular parts of this cross section area). 
Related to this, $\sigma_\text{t}$ in \fref{eq:VC:CSD3} interprets as average conductivity 
experienced by the current ${\bf i}_\text{t}$. 
As this current will face cellular obstacles, 
and is restricted to run only through the extracellular parts of the tissue, 
$\sigma_\text{t}$ is generally lower than the conductivity of the extracellular saline solution 
(see \fref{chap:Sigma} for further discussion). 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\blue{Dipole approximation}}
\label{sec:VC:dipole}
The \textit{dipole approximation}\index{Dipole approximation} is an alternative to \fref{eq:VC:pointsources} 
for predicting the extracellular potential. The approximation is good provided that the 
"measuring point" for $V_\mathrm{e}$ is far away from the source-sink distribution that it originates from, 
like in the case of EEG.

To be more precise, if the distance from the center of the volume containing the current sources 
to the measurement point is larger than the maximal distance from volume center to any source \cite**{Jackson1998}, 
we can reformulate \fref{eq:VC:pointsources} by using the the multipole expansion \cite**{Nunez2006}:
\begin{equation}
V_\mathrm{e}({\bf r}) = V_\mathrm{e}(R) = \frac{C_\mathrm{monopole}}{R} + \frac{C_\mathrm{dipole}}{R^2} + \frac{C_\mathrm{quadrupole}}{R^3} + \frac{C_\mathrm{octopole}}{R^4} + ...
\label{eq:VC:multipole}
\end{equation}
where $R = {\bf r} - {\bf r}_c$ is the distance from the center of the source distribution (${\bf r}_c$), 
$C_\mathrm{monopole}$ is the monopolar contribution of the CSD to $V_\mathrm{e}$, 
$C_\mathrm{dipole}$ is the dipolar contribution from the CSD to $V_\mathrm{e}$, 
and so on. The derivation of this expression can be found in Appendix \ref{app:dipoleappendix}.

As we explained in \fref{sec:Neuron:membranecurrents}, 
the net sum of currents over a neuronal membrane is always zero, 
meaning that the monopolar contribution, i.e., first term in \fref{eq:VC:multipole}, vanishes. 
Furthermore, the quadrupole, octopole and higher-order contributions to $V_\mathrm{e}$ 
decay rapidly with distance $R$. Provided that we are sufficiently far away from the source distribution, 
$V_\mathrm{e}$ can therefore be well approximated by dipole contribution alone:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:VC:CDA}
V_\mathrm{e}({\bf r}) \approx \frac{1}{4 \pi \sigma_t} \frac{|{\bf p}| \cos \theta}{|{\bf r} - {\bf r}_c|^2},
\end{equation}
where we have expressed $C_\mathrm{dipole}$ in terms of the current dipole moment ($\mathbf{p}$) 
and the angle ($\theta$) between the current dipole moment and the distance vector 
($\mathbf{R} = {\bf r} - {\bf r}_c$), as explained in Appendix \ref{app:dipoleappendix}.

The current dipole moment is a function of the sum of all the transmembrane currents in a neuron \cite**{Pettersen2008,Pettersen2014,Nunez2006}:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p} = \sum_{k=1}^N I_k \mathbf{r}_k.
\label{eq:VC:dipole}
\end{equation}
For example, if we have a simple two-compartmental (and purely dipolar) neuron with a current sink $-I$ 
at location $\mathbf{r}_1$ and a current source $I$ at location $\mathbf{r}_2$, 
the current dipole moment can be formulated as 
$\mathbf{p} = -I\mathbf{r}_1 + I\mathbf{r}_2 = I(\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1) = I\mathbf{d}$. 
Here $\mathbf{d}$ is the distance vector between the current sink and the current source, 
giving the length $d$ and direction of the current dipole.

As we mentioned above, 
the current dipole approximation is only applicable when we are at some distance away from the source distribution. 
As a rule of thumb, the approximation is thought to be good when $R$ is three to four times greater than the dipole length: 
$R > 3d$ or $R > 4d$ \cite**{Nunez2006}. 
It has been found to work well for predicting the extracranial EEG signal, 
but less well for intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) \cite**{Naess2020}.

Above, we demonstrated how we can use VC theory to predict the extracellular potential ($V_\mathrm{e}$) 
evoked by neural activity. However, in experiments, $V_\mathrm{e}$ must be measured using some kind of electrode, 
and the measurement equipment can in principle affect what is being measured in several ways, 
depending both on electrode properties and features of $V_\mathrm{e}$. 
Below, we present a short review of different approaches to model such effects. 

Recording electrodes essentially consist of an electrode surface in direct contact with neural tissue, 
connected with a wire to an amplifier that measures the potential relative to a reference electrode \cite**{Martinsen2008}, 
see \fref{fig:VC:elec_circuit}{\bf A}. To accurately measure the potential at the electrode surface, 
the measurement electrodes themselves must have a very low resistance 
so that no potential drop occurs from the measurement site to the amplifier. 
The electrodes are therefore typically made of a highly conductive metal like silver or platinum, 
and the potential directly on the inside of the electrode surface is in practice homogeneous. 
In contrast, the amplifier must have a very high impedance \ghtxt{(frequency dependent resistance)}, 
so that a negligible amount of current will cross the tissue-electrode interface, 
as this can cause electrode polarization effects\index{Electrode polarization} \cite**{Schwan1992,Martinsen2008,Moulin2008,Ishai2013}. 
The homogeneous potential inside the recording electrode ideally corresponds to a spatial average 
of the potential across the outer surface of the electrode \cite**{Nelson2008,Nelson2010,Ness2015,Vermaas2020b}.

For the sake of examining electrode effects, let us consider a specific recording location, and define for
this location:
\begin{itemize}
\item $V_\mathrm{Phys}$: The "physiological" potential, defined as the $V_\mathrm{e}$ that we \textit{would have} at this location in the absence of any measurement equipment. This is the $V_\mathrm{e}$ that we simulate with VC theory.

\item $V_\mathrm{True}$: The "true" potential, which can differ from $V_\mathrm{Phys}$ if it is affected by the electrode. 

\item $V_\mathrm{Rec}$: The recorded potential, reported by the electrode amplifier system to the experimentalist.

%We have demonstrated how we can use VC theory to make predictions about the extracellular potentials at any point in space following some neural activity. However, in experiments these extracellular potentials must be measured through some kind of measurement electrode. The presence of such a measurement electrode might itself affect the measured potentials in several different ways, depending on both the electrode and the extracellular potential that is being measured. 

%\ghtxt{\sout{To understand and/or model such effects it is convenient to represent the recording set-up as an equivalent circuit diagram \cite**{Geddes1997}, see \fref{fig:VC:elec_circuit}{\bf B} for an example inspired by \citeasnoun**{Robinson1968}, \citeasnoun**{Nelson2008}, \citeasnoun**{Obien2015}, and \citeasnoun**{Viswam2019}. Here $V_{\rm e,True}$ is the "true" extracellular potential at some location in the brain, caused by some neural activity, and $V_{\rm Rec}$ is the potential reported by the amplifier. $R_s$ is the resistance of the extracellular medium from the measurement point to the reference electrode. The surface of the electrode, that is, the electrode-electrolyte interface, is often modelled as a resistance, $R_e$, and a capacitance, $C_e$, in parallel (gray shaded area in \fref{fig:VC:elec_circuit}{\bf B}) 
%\cite**{Martinsen2008,Nelson2008,CamunasMesa2013,Viswam2019}. Importantly, the values of both $R_e$ and $C_e$ are typically expected to be highly frequency dependent \cite**{Martinsen2008,Nelson2008,Viswam2019}, and are often considered to be approximately proportional to $1/\sqrt{f}$ \cite**{Robinson1968}, where $f$ is the frequency (implications of this frequency dependence is discussed below).
%The wire from the electrode-electrolyte interface to the amplifier has resistance $R_m$, typically assumed to be negligible.
%$C_{sh}$ and $R_{sh}$ represents all the shunt capacitance and resistance to ground that occurs between the electrode surface and the amplifier, through wires, connections etc., where often $R_{sh}$ is assumed to be negligible.
%Finally, $Z_a$ is the amplifier input impedance.}}

When modeling electrode effects it is convenient to represent the recording set-up as an equivalent circuit diagram \cite**{Geddes1997}. 
An example is shown in \fref{fig:VC:elec_circuit}{\bf B}, where the surface of the electrode 
(the electrode-electrolyte interface), is represented as a resistance, $R_\mathrm{e}$, 
and a capacitance, $C_\mathrm{e}$, in parallel (gray shaded area) \cite**{Martinsen2008,Nelson2008,CamunasMesa2013,Viswam2019}. 
In the figure, $R_\mathrm{s}$ denotes the resistance of the extracellular medium 
from the measurement point to the reference electrode, 
$V_\mathrm{True}$ is the "true" extracellular potential difference between the measurement point and reference electrode, 
while $V_\mathrm{Rec}$ is the potential reported by the amplifier. 
Importantly, the values of both $R_\mathrm{e}$ and $C_\mathrm{e}$ are typically 
expected to be highly frequency dependent \cite**{Martinsen2008,Nelson2008,Viswam2019}, 
and are often considered to be approximately proportional to $1/\sqrt{f}$ \cite**{Robinson1968}, 
where $f$ is the frequency of the recorded signal (implications of this frequency dependence is discussed below). 
The resistance of wire from the electrode-electrolyte interface to the amplifier is denoted $R_\mathrm{m}$, 
and is typically assumed to be negligible. 
$C_\mathrm{sh}$ and $R_\mathrm{sh}$ represent all the shunt capacitance and resistance to ground 
that occur between the electrode surface and the amplifier, through wires, connections etc., 
where often $R_\mathrm{sh}$ is assumed to be negligible. Finally, $Z_a$ is the amplifier input impedance.

Two important concepts in \fref{fig:VC:elec_circuit}{\bf B} are the effective electrode impedance, $Z_e'$, 
and the effective amplifier input impedance, $Z_a'$. The former is the combined impedance of the 
extracellular medium ($R_s$), the electrode-electrolyte interface ($R_e$, $C_e$) and the metal wire ($R_m$), 
while the latter is the total impedance to ground from after the metal wire, 
and includes the shunt currents and the amplifier itself. 
For the recorded potential, $V_{\rm Rec}$ to be as similar as possible to the true potential, $V_{\rm True}$,  
it is vital that $Z_a' \gg Z_e'$. 
If this is not fulfilled, the recorded potential will have frequency-dependent phase- and amplitude distortions \cite**{Nelson2008,Nelson2010,Obien2015,Viswam2019}.
Importantly, the effective electrode impedance, $Z_e'$, increases strongly for low frequencies 
and is typically much more frequency dependent than the effective amplifier input impedance, 
$Z_a'$ \cite**{Nelson2008}. 
This means that some given recording equipment might be able to measure \ghtxt{rapidly varying signals, such as}
extracellular spikes, with negligible distortion, while at the same time substantial 
phase and amplitude distortions might be present in \ghtxt{slower signals, such as local field potentials,} 
\ghtxt{\sout{LFP signals}} measured with the same equipment \cite**{Nelson2008,Nelson2010,Viswam2019}.

Note that metallic recording electrodes are typically unable to measure static (DC) potentials, 
or capture changes slower than $\sim$ 0.1 Hz.
Such DC potentials can be present in neural tissue, and can often arise in simulated 
extracellular potentials from cell models with active conductances, for example because of the 
$I_{\rm h}$-current \cite**{Ness2016}. In such cases, the simulated baseline (or mean) 
extracellular potential is typically subtracted from the extracellular potentials to effectively 
remove the unobservable DC-potential.

Apart from the issues discussed above \ghnote{Hvilke issues? Alle? De som angaar DC-potensialet? Eller mener vi "despite the issues?"}, it has been convincingly argued that, provided that the proper recording equipment is used (so that $Z_a' \gg Z_e'$), 
electrode impedance or other electrode properties should not substantially distort recorded potentials 
\ghtxt{i.e., we can assume that  $V_\mathrm{True} \approx V_\mathrm{Phys}$}  \cite**{Martinsen2008,Moulin2008,Nelson2008,Nelson2010}.
Note that this only applies to recording electrodes, and that substantially more complex 
electrode models might be needed to accurately represent current stimulation electrodes 
because of electrode polarization, see \fref{sec:EPI}.

\ghnote{Hang ikke helt med. I avsn. over sto det "electrode properties should not distort recorded potentials. Under staar det electrode properties can still affect the recorded potential. Hva er forskjellen? Tipper at du foerst mente at elektroden er slik at $V_\mathrm{True} = V_\mathrm{Phys}$, men i neste tilfelle at det ikke noedvendigvis er slik at $V_\mathrm{Rec} \neq V_\mathrm{True}$. Har laget en versjon basert paa den forstaaelsen.}

Under the assumption that the proper recording equipment is used \cite**{Nelson2008,Nelson2010}, 
electrode properties \ghtxt{\sout{can still affect the}} \ghtxt{will nevertheless affect the relationship between the true potential and the} recorded potential \ghtxt{so that $V_\mathrm{Rec} \neq V_\mathrm{True}$}. For example, since the (homogeneous) potential directly on the inside of the electrode surface corresponds to a spatial average of the potential on the outside, the area of the electrode surface will affect how large a region the extracellular potential is averaged over. In practice, this means for example that extracellular \ghtxt{\sout{action potentials}spikes} (which are very spatially confined) will be less prominent on electrodes with diameters larger than $\sim$30~\si{\micro\metre} \cite**{Moffitt2005,Moulin2008,Viswam2019}, see \fref{sec:Spikes:electrode_size}. \ghnote{Kan dette skrivers klarere? Less prominent when larger than 30 mum - less than what, hvorfor 30? Antar det kan skrives generelt: Less prominent the larger the diameter. Er dette rett: Difficult to detect when larger than 30 mum?}

%if the extracellular potential changes across the outer surface of the recording electrode, this can introduce a spatial filtering effect on the measured potentials.
%\gen{Her maa vi vaere presise. Potensialet paa selve elektroden vil vaere det samme, det som vil variere er hva potensialet ville vaert paa denne "virtuelle" flaten hvis det ikke hadde vaert en metallisk elektrode der.}
%In practice, this means for example that extracellular action potentials (which are very spatially confined) will be less prominent on electrodes with diameters larger than $\sim$30~$\mu$m \cite**{Moffitt2005,Moulin2008,Viswam2019}, see Section~\ref{Spikes:sec:elec_size}.


\subsection{\blue{Point-electrode approximation}}
\label{sec:VC:point-electrode}
\index{Point-electrode}
The most straightforward and also most common approach when modeling extracellular recordings is to use the ideal point electrode approximation. This corresponds to ignoring \ghtxt{\sout{any potential effect}possible effects} from recording electrodes or electrode shanks, \ghtxt{assuming that the recorded potential, $V_\mathrm{Rec}$, is identical to the physiological potential, which in turn is identical to $V_\mathrm{e}$ as computed using VC theory.} \ghtxt{\sout{and calculating 
the extracellular potential at single points.}} For relatively small micro-electrodes this has been found to be a reasonable approximation \cite**{Moffitt2005,Moulin2008,Ness2015,Buccino2019}.
\ghnote{Er ikke det rett: Point-electrode approximation = VC-teori uten no knussel?}

\subsection{\blue{Disc-electrode approximation}}
\label{sec:VC:disc-electrode}
\index{Disc-electrode approximation}
\ghtxt{\sout{In some cases recording electrodes are large enough that the the extracellular potential}
Under some experimental conditions  $V_\mathrm{e}$} varies substantially across the electrode surface, 
either because the electrodes are large (like ECoG electrodes at the cortical surface), 
or because \ghtxt{\sout{the extracellular potential}$V_\mathrm{e}$} varies substantially over small distances 
(like extracellular spikes from axons). 
In such cases, we can use \ghtxt{\sout{the point-electrode approximation}VC-theory} to calculate \ghtxt{\sout{the potential}$V_\mathrm{e}$} at \ghtxt{\sout{many}all} points across the electrode surface 
and compute the average potential \ghtxt{as a proxy for $V_\mathrm{Rec}$}, 
an approach referred to as the disc-electrode approximation \cite**{CamunasMesa2013,Linden2014,Hagen2015,Ness2015,Viswam2019}. 
\ghtxt{\sout{This approach takes into account}The disc-electrode approximation accounts for} the physical extent of the electrodes, \ghtxt{\sout{and the disc-electrode approximation can therefore account} and therefore also} for the spatial filtering effects introduced by electrodes that are large compared to the spatial variations of the \ghtxt{\sout{extracellular potential}$V_\mathrm{e}$}. See \fref{sec:Spikes:electrode_size} for an example of this approach applied to calculating extracellular 
spikes recorded with electrodes of different sizes.

However, very close to electrodes the electrodes can themselves affect the close-by extracellular potential, 
since they represent a region of a highly conductive material in contact with the tissue being measured from.
The effect of the presence of highly conductive electrodes can be investigated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) \index{Finite Element Method}. \citeasnoun**{Ness2015} found that the disc-electrode approximation was fairly accurate for estimating measured potentials from a point current source more than $\sim$2 times the electrode radius away from the electrode. The point-electrode approximation was \ghtxt{\sout{also}} found to be fairly accurate for distanced greater than $\sim$4 times the electrode radius away from the electrode, see \fref{fig:VC:FEM_elec}.

In certain cases, like in ECoG \index{ECoG} measurements from the cortical surface, the recording electrodes are both large ($\sim$~2-5~mm diameter) and close to the neuronal sources (the thickness of the human cortex is $\sim$3~mm). In such cases the electrode properties can therefore be expected to have large effect on measured potentials, see for example \citeasnoun**{Vermaas2020b} and \citeasnoun**{Rogers2020}.

\subsection{\blue{Effect of the electrode shanks}}
\label{sec:VC:elec_shafts}
Large multi-contact electrode shanks can be expected to have a substantial effect on close-by extracellular potentials, since they represent large, non-conducting volumes \cite**{Moffitt2005,Lempka2011,Mechler2012,Buccino2019}. It has been demonstrated that such large probes can amplify or dampen recorded potentials from nearby cells by almost a factor of two, depending on whether the cell was in front of or behind the electrode shank \cite**{Moffitt2005,Buccino2019}, while no such effects were found for small microwires \cite**{Buccino2019}. \tvnnote{Can also hurt the brain to push large objects into it, with cell-death, eudema and encapsulation (Moffitt and McIntyre, 2005).}
